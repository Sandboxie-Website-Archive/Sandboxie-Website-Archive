		<a name="v_4_18" id="v_4_18"></a>Version 4.18
	</h3>
	<p>
		Released on 28 May 2015.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li> A security hole with the Windows print spooler has been plugged. An application could use the print spooler to write an arbitrary file outside the sandbox. If Sandboxie detects that the print spooler is attempting to write a file outside the sandbox at the request of a sandboxed application, it will issue "SBIE1319 Blocked spooler print to file".
	</ul>
	<p>
		NOTE: Some printer drivers write temporary files to their own work area, even when not printing to file. In these cases, you will get SBIE1319 even when printing normally (not to file). The print may still print successfully. In this situation, you can safely ignore SBIE1319, hide the error message, or open the folder as described below.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are 3 ways to allow the print spooler to print to file:
	</p>
	<p>
		1) If you trust the process that is printing, you can double-click the SBIE1320 (that follows SBIE1319) to allow the print spooler to write files outside the sandbox for that particular process. 2) The spooler can write files outside the sandbox according to OpenFilePath settings. This enables you to permanently open the folders a particular printer driver uses to store its work files. 3) You can manually add the setting AllowSpoolerPrintToFile=y to sandboxie.ini. This is not recommended as it leaves your sandbox open to a print spooler exploit.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Any error msgs generated when auto-deleting a sandbox will now be shown to the user.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Fixed Chrome SBIE2205 Service not implemented: Win32Init.5 (00000005)
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Added Hitman Pro Alert to templates.ini
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Changed hook for ChangeDisplaySettingsEx() to allow CDS_RESET. A user reported that a game (fifa15) is trying to use this and failing resulting in incorrect display colors.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Distributed File System (DFS) mapped drives are now supported (viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=18825&amp;p=100656)
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> VMWare HGFS (Host Guest File System) mapped drives are now supported.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> A BSOD bugcheck reported by a user when using bittorrent has been removed (this was a rare situation). SbieDrv was detecting corrupted memory when no corruption had occurred.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Fixed a rare bug in clipboard handling that could crash SbieSvc.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> WebEx running under Chrome would sometimes hang.

		<li> Recent Windows update in Win 8-64 causes Skype (and possibly other apps) to issue error SBIE2335 Initialization failed for process Skype.exe

	<h3>
		<a name="v_4_16" id="v_4_16"></a>Version 4.16
	</h3>
	<p>
		Released on 20 Feb 2015.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Major redesign of hooking/injection code. ASLR is now enabled for 64 bit (it was already enabled for 32 bit).
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> VC Redistributables are no longer downloaded by the combined 32/64 installer. The required VC DLLs are now included in the installer binary (which is why it is much larger now).
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> KB3031432 in Win 8-64 causes 64 bit applications to crash.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Sbie now detects when a sandboxed application starts WerFault.exe because it has crashed, and gives WerFault plenty of time to create a crash DMP file.
	</ul>
	<p>
		WerFault has a couple of flaws. It doesn't create the crash DMP until the user presses OK on the crash popup dialog box. If the user does not respond quickly, the crashed application will exit memory and the DMP cannot be created. So now Sbie disables the WerFault dialog box and issues its own SBIE2224 "Sandboxed program has crashed". WerFault also must be given enough time to do various Internet activities before the application exits.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Fixed Outlook 2013 crash at start.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Excel 2013 would remain in memory after program exit.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Fixed several SBIE2318 Dll Initialization Failed issues.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Error SBIE2101 now gives more information.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Increased named pipe timeout from 3 seconds to 10 seconds to eliminate SBIE2101 error.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> A security problem reported by a user has been fixed: hard links could be created outside the sandbox. CreateHardLink API is now blocked.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Removed Avast from the list of known conflicts in templates.ini. This means Sandboxie will no longer popup the dialog box telling you to "review the Known Conflicts page..." when Avast is detected.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Fixed: certificate revocation information is sometimes unavailable. IE occasionally popped up dialog "Revocation information for the security certificate for this site is not available. Do you want to proceed?"
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Sandboxie would issue error SBIE2205 Service not Implemented: LoadedModules.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Fixed drag/drop crash in Chrome.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Added OpenIpcPath=*\BaseNamedObjects*\FntCache to templates.ini to eliminate font cache problems.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Added ClosedFilePath=%SystemRoot%\System32\IDStore.dll &amp; ClosedFilePath=%SystemRoot%\System32\wlidprov.dll to templates.ini to eliminate Windows Live problems.

	<p>
		These are the changes to Sandboxie since <a href="VersionChanges-2.html#v_4_12">version 4.12</a>:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li> There is a new EULA (license.txt)
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Fixed Chrome 37/38 crash error C0000008 (invalid handle).
	</ul>

	</ul>
	<ul>

	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Fixed Excel crash when copying large amounts of data.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Sandboxie now has language support for Farsi (Persian).
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> The auto-update feature only checked the next update time (sandbox.ini setting SbieCtrl_NextUpdateCheck) 1 time when SbieCtrl.exe was started. If SbieCtrl.exe was kept running, it would never check the update time again.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Several large memory leaks (reported by Dr. Larry Pepper et al.) have been fixed. <a href="http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=18412">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=18412</a>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> ASLR is now enabled for SbieDll.dll 32 bit (64 bit will come later).
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> OpenIpcPath=\BaseNamedObjects\FontCachePort is now in templates.ini as a default. Until now, this was a suggested work-around for some Chrome 37 problems.
	</ul>
<pre>
  NOTE: the default only applies to new installs.  For existing installs, you need to go into Sandbox settings-&gt;Applications-&gt;Miscellaneous, and check the option "Allow direct access to Windows Font Cache"
	</pre>
	<ul>
		<li> Added hook for GetProcessImageFileName/NtQueryInformationProcess so it now returns the sandboxed path.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Improvements to the Dutch language text.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> The SbieSvc startup time has been increased from 5 seconds to 15 seconds to eliminate the following sequence of startup errors:
	</ul>
<pre>
   SBIE2335 Initialization failed for process %2
   SBIE2336 Error in GUI server:  %2
   SBIE2337 Failed to start program:  %2
	</pre>
	<ul>
		<li> Malware DarkComet is using a quirk in Windows to put up a MessageBox that does not have the sandboxed yellow window border. This poses no security risk, but to prevent user concern, this has been fixed.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Special flag added to OpenWinClass to restore Buster Sandbox Analyzer (BSA) message logging. /IgnoreUIPI allows low integrity sandboxed processes to send WM_COPYDATA msgs to windows in higher integrity processes.
	</ul>
<pre>
    Example Sandboxie.ini entries (both lines required):
	</pre>
<pre>
    OpenWinClass=TFormBSA
    OpenWinClass=TFormBSA/IgnoreUIPI
	</pre>
	<ul>
		<li> Fixed Sandboxed cmd.exe crash if window title &gt; 256 chars. (<a href="http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=19089">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=19089</a>)
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> Fixed rare BSOD <a href="http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=19076&amp;p=101687">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=19076&amp;p=101687</a>

	<ul>
		<li> Fixed kernel memory leak in SandboxieCrypto <a href="http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=15820">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=15820</a>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li> The combined installer SandboxieInstall.exe now checks for the VC Redistributables DLLs Sandboxie requires. If they are not up to date (10.0.40219.325), the installer will download and install the VC Redist. from sandboxie.com.
	</ul>
	<p>
		If SandboxieInstall.exe tries to download the VC Redistributables and fails, there is now a retry option.
	</p>
<pre>
    To clarify:
    SandboxieInstall.exe does not contain MS VC DLLs.  If they are not already installed or are not up to date, the installer will download the VC Redist. installer package and execute it.
    SandboxieInstall32.exe &amp; SandboxieInstall64.exe contain the DLLs Sandboxie requires.  If they are not installed or are not up to date, the installer copies the ones required into system32.  The VC Redist. installer is not downloaded or executed.

		Windows Installer service can be started inside the sandbox, allowing a greater range of applications to be installed. (Since 2.31)
	</p>
	<p>
		Sandboxie Installer creates "Run Sandboxed" shortcut for MSI Installer packages. (Since 2.33)
	</p>
	<p>
		Auto-complete information is pulled from the outside system into the sandbox, allowing input boxes on Web forms and password information to have information readily available inside the sandbox. (Since 2.35)
	</p>
	<p>
		Easier configuration for a sandboxed Thunderbird mailbox and sandboxed Firefox bookmarks.
	</p>
	<p>
		Configurabe "linger" processes, that would be automatically terminated if they are the last ones in the sandbox.

		<a name="v_2_0" id="v_2_0"></a>Version 2.0
	</h3>
	<p>
		Released on 19 August 2005.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Changes since <a href="VersionChanges-2.html#v_1_85">version 1.85</a>.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Improved security and isolation of sandboxed programs that are trying to reach into and alter non-sandboxed programs.
	</p>
	<p>
		Automatic support for running Outlook Express sandboxed and not losing mail. Possible also with other mail programs, after some further configuration.
	</p>
	<p>
		Delete Contents of Sandbox can start automatically after all sandboxed programs are closed, or when Sandboxie itself closes. New Quick Recovery tool allows for easy one-click recovery of files before the sandbox is emptied.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sandboxie can issue alerts when specific programs are started outside the sandbox.
	</p>
	<p>
		Easier installation of desktop and quick-launch shortcuts to run your Web browser sandboxed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Shadow registry keys that represent sandboxed registry keys will be discarded when the computer restarts. (They are all empty anyway.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Small performance improvement due to less files being copied into the sandbox, if the files are not going to be updated.
	</p>
	<p>
		Improved support for concurrent use of Sandboxie by multiple users of the same computer. (For users sharing a computer through Fast User Switching or Terminal Services)
	</p>
	<p>
		Now configurable: the folder where the sandbox resides; the size limit for copying files into the sandbox (previously fixed at 32MB).
	</p>
	<p>
		New concept of "Open" and "Closed" paths allowing specific programs full-access or no-access, respectively, to specific folders and registry keys.

	<p>
		Released on 10 April 2005.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Changes since <a href="VersionChanges-2.html#v_1_7">version 1.7</a>.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Sandboxie implements auto-complete for Web forms and other uses. (Auto-complete data entered when using Sandboxie is not visible outside the sandbox.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Note: It may be necessary to empty the sandbox once, after upgrading to version 1.8, before the auto-complete feature becomes usable. This is because previous versions of Sandboxie purposely disabled this feature inside the sandbox.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Run Program... dialog now maintains a history of typed commands. Automatic command completion now works with both Windows 2000 as well as Windows XP.
	</p>
	<p>
		The audio device becomes accessible within the sandbox.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sandboxed programs may install icons in the system notification area. Specifically this means better support for the Avant browser.
	</p>
	<p>
		Resolved the conflict with the Zone Alarm firewall product.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fixed a problem with Internet access when the proxy setting is set to automatic proxy detection. This typically manifested itself as a browser trying to detect proxy settings indefinately.
	</p>
	<p>
		And more features to increase overall stability and the range of usable programs. (It is now possible to run even the Windows Calculator under Sandboxie.)

	<p>
		<strong>Changes since <a href="VersionChanges-2.html#v_1_6">version 1.6</a>.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Sandboxie is now able to run a sandboxed instances of most programs side-by-side with the unsandboxed instances of the same program. This means Firefox should now be on the same level of usability with Sandboxie as Internet Explorer is.
	</p>
	<p>
		A new Run Program... feature in Sandboxie Control adds the ability to launch any program.
	</p>
	<p>
		Nicer dialog for Empty Sandbox, which also deletes the shadow registry keys created for the sandbox.
	</p>
	<p>
		Opening or explorer a folder from within a sandboxed process will open the target folder sandboxed.
	</p>
	<p>
		For better system protection, Sandboxed programs are not allowed access to the system Service Control Manager.

		Released on 5 February 2005.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Changes since <a href="VersionChanges-2.html#v_1_502">version 1.502</a>.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		This version of Sandboxie fixes many problems with the isolated COM framework that is used by programs running under the control of Sandboxie.
	</p>
	<p>
		The long standing problem of Internet Explorer not coming up has been resolved, at least in some of the cases. In those cases that I observed, it was waiting for the Sandboxie COM framework to come up, but that framework was hung.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's now possible to embed ActiveX Controls and OLE compound documents within applications. For example, viewing a PDF document using Internet Explorer opens the document (using Acrobat Reader) within the browser, rather than out of the browser.
	</p>
	<p>
		Web radio is now possible, again due to better COM suport, though I have experienced some problems getting it to work under Windows 2000.
	</p>
	<p>
		The system driver is started later in the initialization process of the system, in order to reduce possibility of conflict with other drivers. This change has resolved a system crash with a blue screen at least in one case.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sandboxie Control can now work even when started by a restricted user in the system.
	</p>
	<p>
		Stronger isolation of sandboxed processes from the outside system: more system object classes, in addition to disk files and registry keys, are now sandboxed.
	</p>
	<p>
		A few very minor tweaks to improve performance.
