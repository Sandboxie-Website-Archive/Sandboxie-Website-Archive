Keep bringing this up? The Firefox thing? So 2 months and several releases isn't long enough before letting you know, since it seemed to be forgotten about? Or it's not fixable or you don't want to fix it...? I said that's why I replied, and this is "Things that don't work..."<br><br>Or you mean about the speed stuff? Well, you're the one that started posting about it in <em>this</em> topic instead of the other one <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink">, so I just mentioned something else quick... I figured I'd wait at least a month, since you're busy with other stuff, and then I didn't have anything else to say anyway until I came up with this benchmark/test (which I'd post later, and still only replied for Firefox).<br><br>So I don't see how waiting patiently forever is "keeping" bringing something up. <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> What, has it been almost 9-10 months since the EMET crashes with Firefox that Sandboxie consistently and constantly keeps causing? It's been about 6 months since I posted any more details about that (might again soon, after seeing some other user comments), since I gave tons of info, but I don't know if you tried to look into it much -- and I asked about any tools I could use to help debug, etc.....<br><br>Also not sure why you keep telling me about MY time, haha. <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> I have many different things to spend time on, and try to allocate it as best I can. It's a pretty small amount on this (and more of that was to give YOU info), but it had to be done. It's not like I can forget about it, since I'm stuck with either: 1) [Additional] slowness, or 2) Not configured to my liking. <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br><br>Are you going to tell me about how I THINK about spending time also (vs actual time used)? That was a couple months ago I <em>thought</em> about making some tool specifically for this (it's that bad, and want to get others' results), but never spent a single minute on anything...<br><br>Then I woke up last week and magically thought of this idea (think flux capacitor!). Within 30 minutes of getting up, I had it working and haven't touched it since (want to tweak before "release"). Is that a small enough time?? <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":o" title="Surprised"> Maybe you don't want a simple (superb/indisputable/dramatic) way for people to check? I just want to know what others are seeing with different settings, and this is easy and reliable.<br><br>I just checked it on Firefox (window creation, not launching), and got the same relative results. Although everything takes a lot less time overall, which is probably why I've hardly ever "felt" anything with Firefox.<br><br><br>BTW, after buying the license last Sep., I wanted to post a Positive Review, but never got around to it before the end of the year. Then I decided to wait after version 4 came out. Now I think everything is good functionality-wise (so I'm generally satisfied! <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">), but I cannot post said review until I see what's up with this (as long as there are conflicts between logic, your explanations, and my results)... Then I'd have the review within 30 days (even letting the EMET issue slide) -- that <em>would be</em> a promise, but I have to watch how I spend my time!!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11108">DR_LaRRY_PEpPeR</a> — Thu Jul 11, 2013 7:56 am</p><hr />

Since it's been <a href="http://www.sandboxie.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=89910#89910" class="postlink">almost 2 months</a>, just wanted to let you know that the remaining Firefox/Pale Moon focus issue is still there on XP:<br><blockquote><div><cite>DR_LaRRY_PEpPeR wrote:</cite>Firefox is mostly fixed, and seemed good for awhile, but found another scenario where it's not refocusing. <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> Focus: unsandboxed; sandboxed Firefox; and another unsandboxed. Minimize that last unsandboxed window, and then Firefox -- the next unsandboxed window is there, but not focused. (That's what would happen before if any other sandboxed windows were already minimized.)</div></blockquote><br><br>About the speed differences with different OpenWinClass settings... (BTW, I wondered if the global Open=* change in 4.03.01 would change its speed at all, but seems the same (just info; it was/is already fastest...)).<br><br>Just last week I came up with an excellent and simple test that I'll post sometime soon, that others can easily check differences with (online and/or download). (Since I find AppTimer can give results that are "off" if not used carefully.) Not sure why I didn't come up with this sooner -- I had even been thinking about making some other timing program (ugh) just for this for people to check with, since it's so annoying... I still have to check the script on my other combinations of Windows/IE to make sure it works right.<br><br>Besides timing launching (results look like "right" AppTimer ones), I also have a version that shows the big differences creating windows in the already open IE (or any browser I guess, but I haven't timed anything but IE so far), which is really most of the difference with launching...<br><br>I would say the differences shown are about proportional to the differences I feel in some other windowing-related areas... Anyway, more on that later (just replied for Firefox issue), assuming there's no other findings/explanation/improvement coming yet. <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11108">DR_LaRRY_PEpPeR</a> — Wed Jul 10, 2013 8:18 am</p><hr />

As I said earlier in this topic, these changes are internal, and do not change the way you use Sandboxie.<br><br>Settings may be evaluated at a different point during program execuion, but they are evaluated the same way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">tzuk</a> — Wed Jul 03, 2013 7:08 am</p><hr />

As for the new version, I'm curious about a few things.<br>As you stated, the main behaviour now is restricting before allowing which I really appreciate.<br><br>I didn't like a few main ways of behaviour in the old versions.<br>Mainly the part where you had to restrict access to specific files instead of allowing it.<br>Has this changed?<br><br>For example:<br>I want Firefox to be able to read a specific Filepath on a drive but no other path.<br>Do I now have the option to ONLY allow the access to this specific path?<br>So to whitelist only one path instead of having to blacklist every other path on that drive?<br><br>Thanks<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4128">Blackbeat</a> — Tue Jul 02, 2013 7:14 pm</p><hr />
