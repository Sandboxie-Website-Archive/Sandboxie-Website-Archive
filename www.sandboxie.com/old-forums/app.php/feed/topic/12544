Update: I've ignored my own advise, and added simple DDE support to SandboxieReflector.  This will allow you to also reflect file and protocol associations which rely on DDE to transfer the correct data to the receiving app.  Note that setting this up will not be as easy as setting up simple command line reflecting, so it's probably only for the more experienced users.<br><br>I didn't want to spend a lot of time on this and thus I resorted to a hack (for the DDE insiders: I just pass on the WM_DDE_INITIATE message unmodified from the Reflector to the target app and be done with it), so I do not know if it will work all the time on all platforms.  It does work on Windows XP though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9066">Carl Colijn</a> — Tue Mar 13, 2012 9:14 am</p><hr />

Hello! Thank you for considering the suggestion.<br>Your approach is good, but the command would still depend on the CmdLine from the INI file, while a raw interpretation wouldn't.<br><br>An example. Let's say I run the following user command from my sandboxed file manager (which would replace $I, $R, $L with file paths or whatever):<div class="codebox"><p>CODE: </p><pre><code>"C:\Program Files\SandboxieReflector\Reflector.exe" /exec &lt;profilename&gt; "D:\MyApp.exe" /I="$I" /R="$R" /L="$L" /Type=Mov /Notify="C:\Windows\Media\ding.wav"</code></pre></div>In this case, the CmdLine property in SandboxieReflector.ini for the invoked profile could be null, like CmdLine="" and Effectuator.exe would run<div class="codebox"><p>CODE: </p><pre><code>"D:\MyApp.exe" /I="$I" /R="$R" /L="$L" /Type=Mov /Notify="C:\Windows\Media\ding.wav"</code></pre></div>or, if it is possible, introduce a /raw parameter whose value is concatenated to the ini CmdLine property (which can be null).<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"C:\Program Files\SandboxieReflector\Reflector.exe" /exec &lt;profilename&gt; <span style="color: red"><strong>/raw</strong></span> "D:\MyApp.exe" /I="$I" /R="$R" /L="$L" /Type=Mov /Notify="C:\Windows\Media\ding.wav"</div></blockquote>Of course, the call is yours, and as I said before, I'm already using your applications in conjunction with one of mine to get the desired functionality.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9514">MichaelS</a> — Wed Feb 29, 2012 12:18 pm</p><hr />

<blockquote><div><cite>MichaelS wrote:</cite>Carl, I know you said you do not wish to improve or further extend your application, unless it's a bug-fix or vulnerability issue, and I completely understand if you do not want to implement the following suggestion:<br><br>Add an alternative version of the Reflector and/or Effectuator that allows the Reflector to pass raw command lines to the Effectuator, so it is not confined to the /file parameter.</div></blockquote>Hi MichaelS,<br><br>A more generic method would be to pass all parameters along via a dedicated /p switch, with "/p file" a good replacement for the "/file" in use now.  Something like:<div class="codebox"><p>CODE: </p><pre><code>Reflector.exe /exec &lt;profile name&gt; [/p &lt;param name&gt; &lt;param value&gt; [&lt;param value&gt; ...]] </code></pre></div>and the profile code something like:<div class="codebox"><p>CODE: </p><pre><code>CmdLine=MyApp.exe [$&lt;param name&gt; [$&lt;param name&gt; ...]] </code></pre></div>As an example:<div class="codebox"><p>CODE: </p><pre><code>Reflector.exe /exec MyProfile /p file "%1",CmdLine=MyApp /open $file</code></pre></div>and:<div class="codebox"><p>CODE: </p><pre><code>Reflector.exe /exec MyProfile /p I "$I" /p R "$R" /p L "$L"CmdLine=MyApp /left_path=$L /other=$R /and_even=$I</code></pre></div>Just like the Effectuator now looks for all %1's in the cmdlines and complains if there is an unmatch with any /file switch, it could just as easily compare all /p's in the same manner.<br><br>I'm already breaking my own promise of not improving the code by looking if initial DDE proxying support is easy to add, so the above would be a quick addition as well <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink">  No promise on a time frame, but the idea intrigues me!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9066">Carl Colijn</a> — Wed Feb 29, 2012 10:31 am</p><hr />
