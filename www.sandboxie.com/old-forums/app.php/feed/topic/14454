Hello, I just installed the new version of sandboxie and now I am not able to read encrypted files (using EFS) under the sandboxes, my guess is it happens because now the sandboxed processes are opened using the ANONYMOUS LOGON account, tzuk, is there any workaround to fix this?

Hi,<br><br>I have to partially agree with nicknomo: Sandboxie is an insanely useful tool in that you can shield your real system (files&amp;registry) by installing updates to apps inside a sandbox and rolling it back at will with absolutely no consequence whatsoever on the real system. Many other tools that are not perfect in this area, in my experience.<br><br>You can also install an app in a sandbox and move that sandbox from computer to computer, effectively turning the app into a portable app. It's pretty cool when you are restoring the system regularly; you don't lose the registry keys and C: files that were added in between because they are nicely stored within a sandbox. You don't have to waste disk space imaging incrementally, not to mention that it's a modular approach whereas incremental imaging is linear and so, much less flexible.<br><br>Unfortunately not all apps can be successfully installed in a sandbox, but that's still pretty awesome.<br><br><br>So I agree with Nicknomo, these ways to use Sandboxie are half of its awesomeness. However I still DO care about security when using Sandboxie this way, so I'm not too fond of the default allow idea.<br><br>But then again I don't understand why it poses a problem with v4...if anyone cares to explain that would be super nice <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br><br>Either way, looking forward to v4 ! Though now I'll be careful and do some research before installing it, see if it supports my use cases. <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sat Jun 08, 2013 7:42 pm</p><hr />

I just got a chance to read this.  It sounds like the new implementation in v4 is more secure by impleneting a default deny philosophy.<br><br>My concern, and I think part of the problems I've already experienced, is that I'm not always using Sandboxie as a protection against malware, or for security.  Some times my goal is to simply virtualize the writes to the file system/registry/etc, while not being concerned about what it does from a security perspective.  In other words, to use it as a way to do something without having permanent changes applied to the disk.  For instance, my flight simulator often has updates that are half baked. I typically use Sandboxie to update the software and see if that update is worth keeping.  If not, I just delete the contents of the Sandbox.  I don't really care about being "breached" or about system security in this case.  My main concern is really that the software is able to run and function.<br><br>The way I see it is that the two different uses seem to have very different ideologies, and sometimes they are opposed to one another... and to be honest, I'm pretty amazed at the level of support you've been able to provide so that the use of Sandboxie can be so flexible... It sounds though like the new implementation might make it harder for the latter of the two uses.<br><br>I guess my concern is the that new approach might harm usability in some instances where the extra security is not really wanted.<br><br>Have you ever considered implementing a "compatibility mode" option in the Sandbox settings, that is more along the lines of "default allow" rather than "default deny"?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4528">nicknomo</a> — Fri May 31, 2013 3:23 am</p><hr />
