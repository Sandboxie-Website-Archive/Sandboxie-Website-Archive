Thanks about this writeup, and in the other topic.  I'm going to look into a couple of other problems before I go back to these issues, so I'm going to come back later with a more thorough response to your response.

I have Task Manager screenshots before and after closing sandboxed programs. It was active for 20 days, and you can see kernel memory drop 200 MB (same as 3.x). Also running that whole time, OE, and its memory usage increased continuously (maybe slower at the end) and well as SBIE's GuiProxy process (same PIDs as earlier Process Explorer screenshot), and that did NOT drop at all after closing stuff... I'll watch .05 now.

I immediately noticed populating and scrolling the ListView controls (Explorer, OE messages, etc.) was very fast again (no need to measure).

Haha, no I see that's not true now, and I guess what fixed the ListView stuff <em>really</em> fixed PerformanceTest: I'm seeing like <strong>20% better</strong> Windows Interface scores sandboxed now, compared to UNsandboxed! <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> Not sure how that's happening (maybe FindWindow() is faster sandboxed without "other" windows? *shrug*)<br><br><br>That's all I thought there'd be to report, until I wanted to verify that Recent Documents still won't work at all... I hadn't tried with OpenWin=* on the main system before to check Recent Docs, but I did that and launched IE 6 to do a test "Save As," and guess what? It was WAY faster, felt nearly like 3.76! I waited till later to get some AppTimer numbers from the laptop, but... Basically no difference there; few hundredths, but I'd expect that if a whole chunk of code is bypassed with * <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> So then before my other post yesterday, back to this system to check AppTimer...<br><br>(This is all about launching IE 6.) Main system, usual SBIE settings: <strong>1.22s</strong> (I originally said over a second, though I hadn't timed anything in forever here), which I think is better than .04 going by laptop comparisons. When I just added OpenWin=*, that dropped to <strong>0.5s</strong>!<br><br>I only have a few OpenWin, including 2 templates (AutoSizer, EMET), so would try removing them. One of the first was for Recent Documents (since it doesn't work anyway):<br><br>OpenWinClass=&lt;Open/Save Files&gt;,$:explorer.exe<br><br>Bingo! Somewhat. That takes launch time down to <strong>0.7s</strong>. Besides launching, interface stuff is much better then, but I still feel/see some slowness with new windows, Open/Save... But with Open=*, that stuff is <em>nearly</em> as fast as 3.76, but not quite. I can no longer see slow redrawing (like OE toolbar), but still feel a delay with windows opening (even though it's VERY fast compared to 4.01 with Open=$:explorer).<br><br>The slight remaining extra slowness vs 3.76 is about proportional to  the launch difference. For reference, IE with 3.76 takes <strong>0.4s</strong> (<strong>0.37</strong> with Open=* [again, expected with code bypass]; NO other OpenWin settings have an effect), and &lt; <strong>0.2s</strong> unsandboxed.<br><br>Back to 4.01: I wanted to see if i could get more details for you, so I tried other stuff 12 hours ago. Does the number of OpenWin entries matter? No, tried adding 20 different Dummy windows. Program prefix/group/number of group programs matter? Nope.<br><br>Then the last thing I tried was <strong>really interesting</strong>. <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> Use * with a prefix (Open=iexplore.exe,*): takes <strong>2.7s</strong>!

Thanks.

I just reverted back to the earliest laptop image before anything was installed other than wired network driver (no permissions altered yet, just some "cleanup" of the Windows install I do, nothing harmful <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">). Installed PerformanceTest and SBIE 4.01.04. Ran 2D - Windows Interface benchmark unsandboxed, which was SLOW without the video driver installed: barely 10% of what it was with driver. Running it sandboxed actually managed to score 92% of unsandboxed (since that was SO slow to begin with), but yes, distinctly slower score still.<br><br>Installed the Intel video driver (skipped INF chipset software stuff),and reran PerformanceTest: ~60% this time instead of the ~58% I got the other day.<br><br>So, before attempting a test reinstall, I figured I'd try on the Win 7 system! 2.4 GHz Celeron G530 w/ HD 2000 graphics. As I said, basically untouched 64-bit SP1 install, other than Media Center and supporting stuff. I already had 3.76 (w/ EP) sitting there, so I installed PerformanceTest 8.0 into a sandbox with default settings (as all have been for these tests, BTW). I ran 2D benchmarks in 3.76 to see the baseline (presumably same as unsandboxed) for Windows Interface. I found it interesting that it was a lot lower than even the weak graphics laptop (I guess the Vista/7 desktop/window system (Aero?) is just like that...).<br><br>Anyway, after installing 4.01.04, exactly the same result as XP laptop! No more than <strong>60%</strong> of 3.76's score. <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> Wow.<br><br><br>Then I decided to try the "this is a test" regedit search there in the entire registry.

Hmm, I hope so too, I'm glad I noticed this as soon as I could, and wish I had sooner. <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> That laptop isn't a system I've really used, and I was just testing SBIE functionality on it 2 months ago after initial release, so I didn't really have a baseline feel...<br><br>You only try XP in a VM? Could it only happen on a "real" system? Haven't measured anything -- what about just a simple regedit search like I did? Are you saying registry access is as fast as 3.76? Yes, it seems like something that fundamental <em>should</em> be the same, but I obviously have way slower.<br><br>Since I can't REinstall everything for a "fully usable real system" with programs and all, I mostly just have the bare laptop install to go by, with program launch times, regedit, and this 2D benchmark. Though that seems to be plenty to compare with 3.76. <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br><br>About that other topic with the Windows 7/IE 9 user mentioning slowdown: I have another system (Sandy Bridge) with 64-bit Win 7 which I've hardly looked at as far as Sandboxie, so I could try these simple tests there too... Setup from an untouched SP1 ISO, and other than setting up drivers and Media Center stuff, I haven't touched it, since I'm not so familiar with 7, of course. <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br><br><br>What sort of XP install are YOU using?

Does SBIE <em>need</em> any update since SP3...?<br><br>I would be absolutely shocked if there was any difference. I haven't really done any sort of "screwy" tweaks as part of my installs (or after) like some people, so I don't really see anything that would make a difference. I make Home install as Pro which basically only changes the "XP Home" in a few places and would allow me to disable Simple File Sharing if I wanted... I integrate the Intel SATA AHCI driver during install; could drop that and install with IDE (again, can't imagine a problem here <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink">). Just some info mostly in my WINNT.SIF. Shortly after install, I tweak folder/file permissions precisely with SetACL to tighten stuff running with SRP dropped rights (outside of SBIE). I have an image before the permission changes, which I can try to install SBIE from there before full reinstall to see if that's any different. That would probably be most drastic changes, but again, I can't see a problem...<br><br>Just saw your edit.

DR_LaRRY_PEpPeR, I am not doubting that you're seeing this drastic hit on performance.  But it has to be something unique because I don't experience anything like that.  My feeling is that version 4.01 performance is very comparable to version 3.76.  I haven't measured anything because I didn't feel that I need to.<br><br>I tried running XP in a VM with an execution cap of 10% and everything was slow, but same kind of slow for programs in and out of the sandbox, so even under such a strained condition I wasn't able to see a difference that I could analyze.<br><br>You said you have a custom installation of Windows (you mentioned slipstreamed updates).  Maybe you've also tweaked Windows in some other way that triggers this behavior on your system.  I certainly hope that we end up figuring this out but at this point I don't really have any idea what might be causing this.<br><br>Can you look at the DLLs loaded into the SbieSvc GuiProxy process to see if there are any unexpected third party DLLs in there?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">tzuk</a> — Thu Mar 21, 2013 3:43 pm</p><hr />
