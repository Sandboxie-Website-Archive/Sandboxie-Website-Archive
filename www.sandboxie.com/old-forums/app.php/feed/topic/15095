Please check version 4.01.06.<br><br>Please note:  From my checks and my point of view, it seems the Online Armor Program Guard component gets locked up,<br>when it is running in the context of a program that is supervised by Sandboxie v4 and trying to block access to some resource.<br><br>My workaround is for programs in the sandbox to bypass some of the hooks placed by Program Guard.  This may not work in all system configurations as other hooks inserted by other security software may confuse this workaround.<br><br>Also, the workaround is currently limited to the few Program Guard hooks that I found to be relevant.  You may still get lock up,<br>in that case please tell me which program is triggering the lock up.  It is easy to find out which program triggered the lock up,<br>by restarting the computer after the lock up, and inspecting the History view in Online Armor and locate a history entry for a<br>resource that was blocked.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">tzuk</a> — Mon Apr 22, 2013 6:41 am</p><hr />

Tzuk, I can confirm that the issue still exists.<br><br>I downloaded and installed the new beta you released today.

I could see after some time that SBIE was trying to load the app in the designated sandbox but it was not completed successfully and I could neither terminate the sandbox nor reboot without a hard reset.<br><br>Reinstalled 3.76 and ran "Hasher" from the forced downloads folder and it ran as normal.  <br><br>So, at least now we know that it's neither the OA beta nor stable release of OA which is at the heart of the matter as both run the forced folder and executable fine under 3.76.<br><br>Wish I had better news to report.  I'll be sticking with 3.76 until a resolution to the issue can be found.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2603">Blues</a> — Wed Apr 10, 2013 12:06 pm</p><hr />
