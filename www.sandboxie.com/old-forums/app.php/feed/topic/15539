I have always had the "delete function" enabled.  I had never seen those before and I haven't change my configuration since v3.76 or before.  Drop Rights has always been enabled in prior versions since it became available.  I did notice that "silverlight configuration" tried to run so I allowed as I am running with restrictions.  Still don't understand why a Windows Update service is trying to run inside my Firefox sandbox.<br><br>dja2k<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=960">dja2k</a> — Tue Jun 11, 2013 3:03 pm</p><hr />

Alright, this should be taken care of in version 4.01.13.  There was something similar for XP in version 4.01.09 but that was causing problem, and I had to undo that change.  Hopefully I won't have to undo this change as well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">tzuk</a> — Sun Jun 02, 2013 2:32 pm</p><hr />

Just found it! Same thing was happening on fresh VirtualBox install, even after I applied latest updates (yet I can't reproduce on main system). It was pretty well untouched I figured, except checking over my stuff again quickly, I saw one of the things I DO change initially, just until after I'm done installing everything on a new install:<br><br>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\<strong>nodefaultadminowner</strong> = 0 (instead of default 1)<br><br>So if owner of stuff (objects) tries to be Admin, Sandboxie fails since .08 with Drop Rights. You probably might want to fix this, since it IS a real, legitimate thing people can set (it's a Group Policy option, I believe).<br><br><br>Extra info (unrelated to Sandboxie): I was going to use that setting full-time back when I first discovered dropping rights (before Sandboxie <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">), but found that it caused some really, <em>really</em> random/weird things to happen for IE 6 with dropped rights. And on the laptop, it nearly killed me trying to figure out why the Dell wireless thing wouldn't work (running full Admin!), until I discovered it was failing because nodefaultadminowner=0, but ONLY because I hadn't yet set a password for the account!? Strange, strange stuff. I only use it now, temporarily, to make sure installed system stuff/programs is not owned by the user (to protect with dropped rights).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11108">DR_LaRRY_PEpPeR</a> — Wed May 29, 2013 10:20 am</p><hr />
