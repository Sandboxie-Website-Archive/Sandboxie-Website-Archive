Hi, I also had the same problem with several of my games, and they all worked fine once i turned off the option "Monitor the system for unauthorized modifications" under behavior shield settings. I actually set it off when starting then turned it back on once it was running but the game kept on working fine so it seems to only matter when applications are starting, or when sandboxie is initializing.<br>Btw, it used to work perfectly fine in ver 3.x<br><br>Hope it gets fixed<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Wed Jul 10, 2013 10:03 pm</p><hr />
