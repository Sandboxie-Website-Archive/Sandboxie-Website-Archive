Hello Pete, I got the idea of working with other programs in a sandbox from bo.elam [Howdy Bo!

We are both members over at Gizmo's Freeware too.<br><br>For one, it doesn't take much to run SoftMaker sandboxed and work on my documents.  In fact, I've gotten quite used to it.  There's the safety aspect of course, but it's almost zero in my case, so it's not why I work in a sandbox.  The main reason is it keeps my system cleaner.  When I'm done creating or editing a document, I recover it from the sandbox and delete everything else.  I also do this whenever I need to touch up my photos.<br><br>As it is, Windows stores enough crap on my system, so the more I can cut down on that sort of thing the better.  What I do suits me, but not everyone may want to do the same.  I also use CCleaner every so often, but ever since I started working in a sandbox, CCleaner finds less to clean up.<br><br>If I want to change certain settings in the programs that I run in SBIE, then I make those changes outside of a sandbox so they will stick.<br><br>It's good to hear you have no issues with MS Office and Acrobat Pro in a sandbox, but it's certainly not the same with SoftMaker and SBIE 4.02.  I repeat, everything worked before I upgraded to 4.02.<br><br>P.S.  Not related, but I can't get formatting (like Bold, Italic, etc.) to work on this forum either.

Ahh!  I see where I wasn't clear enough and what I posted before could be confusing.  Sorry about that, I'll try to clarify it now.<br><br>I often create new .DOC or .XLS documents or edit them in a sandbox.  Here's an example:<br><br>1.  I start TextMaker (the SoftMaker word processing module) in a sandbox,<br><br>2.  I create a new document,<br><br>3.  I start typing some text in the document,<br><br>4.  Now say I want to switch to a larger font, I click on the small triangle next to the point-size icon in the toolbar but it doesn't present a drop-down menu - nothing happens!<br><br>5.  I also discover I can't switch the font (e.g. Times Roman to Calibri) or the color either!<br><br>6.  So I stuck with those settings!<br><br>I have found several functions that are broken in paragraph and character formatting in the toolbar.  Others are broken in the main menu bar too, under Format--&gt;Character or Paragraph.  There may be more broken functions I haven't discovered yet.  The strange thing is everything used to work perfectly before upgrading to SBIE 4.02.<br><br>Similar functions are also broken in PlanMaker (SoftMaker's spreadsheet module).<br><br>Please let me know if you are still confused by my explanations and I'll see if I can elaborate.<br><br>Thanks!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16299">Joe_</a> — Sat Jun 22, 2013 5:43 pm</p><hr />
