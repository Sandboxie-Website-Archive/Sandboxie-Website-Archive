<blockquote><div><cite>compeqcloudy wrote:</cite>maybe i can try to rebuild sandboxie.ini and all sandboxs</div></blockquote>Yeah, creating a new sandbox and trying Foxit in it is a good idea. You can also try the latest beta, 4.03.03. I just installed it in my XP and I can tell you, SBIE V4 feels better today than yesterday. <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"> <br><br>Bo<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2542">bo.elam</a> — Tue Jul 02, 2013 12:19 am</p><hr />
