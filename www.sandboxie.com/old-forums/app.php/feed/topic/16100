I haven't tried to use it since testing (it's a setting I forget about), although I would if drag-and-drop worked (no, I don't expect it to <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">) since everything seems fine with nearly NO speed loss. (I don't care about class prefixing anyway.) It was just the small bug when using it where Recent Documents no longer works -- OpenWinClass=Progman or $:explorer.exe doesn't work then, though other OpenWinClass stuff is OK.<br><br>Otherwise it works as in 3.76 AFAICT, and according to the <a href="http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?OpenWinClass" class="postlink">OpenWinClass page</a>. The setting IS still used in the StrokeIt Template, and I just wanted to report it, even though it's not affecting me now.

Thanks for checking.  I'm glad you're happy with the results and I hope we can put this subject to rest.  For now if not for good.<br><br>As for what I did, it's very simple, given specfic scenarios, I looked for calls to SbieSvc and where it made sense and the change was trivial,<br>I got rid of those calls.  As for CreateWindow, there was that lengthy part at the end that you identified.  For a hierarcy of CreateWindow calls (e.g. when the parent window is creating its child windows while responding to WM_CREATE), there is no need to do the lenghty part every time, it's enough to do that at the top level.  So your GUI Bench does not show a difference, while some practical scenarios do.<br><br>I don't know about OpenWinClass=#.  It should just not put the Sandbox: prefix on window class names and that saves hooking a few APIs related to window class names.  I've not spent much time to make sure it works well in v4.<br><br>Alright, let's conclude this one.  Thank you DR_LaRRY_PEpPeR and pastuch for keeping at this thing, sorry I was impatient at times, I hope all's well that ends well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">tzuk</a> — Wed Aug 14, 2013 2:53 pm</p><hr />

Just reporting how each thing changed differently (strange), not a problem.<br><br>FYI: NOW, stuff starts out just about as fast as OpenWinClass=<strong>#</strong> (I can't really see a difference at all). Of course the small degradation (much less than before) doesn't keep things as fast as Open=# that I was asking about.<br><br>On main XP system, all with my "usual active" stuff open: IE <em>launch</em> before ANY changes (4.05.03) was ~1s, first change dropped to 0.88 (these would both degrade remember), and now it's down to 0.7. Even adding 20+ IE windows to what's already open, it only increases to 0.76-0.8. <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> The launch improvement FEELS better than the times, it seems.<br><br>I have to add 20-24 IE windows before the "window opening" slows down to what it was in 4.05.04.

Hadn't checked it much lately, and the absolute times don't vary as much with nothing on the system or running, but the relative improvements look expected.<br><br><br><br>A question about the 0.2s+ difference I see between OpenWinClass of * and # (and defaults now, initially) when launching IE or Firefox, or IE window opening. Obviously the Job adds some access overhead we talked about IN sandbox (250k+ accesses for 0.2s), and more for GuiProxy when needed.

<strong>barny</strong>: No, I don't have that, although I did just recently find the topic you're referring to from Google (and good to know <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">). Although I do have a FAT32 partition on 2 systems for storing my old version of Ghost's image files, but nothing else should be touching that (only a few files anyway).<br><br><strong>pastuch</strong>: Yeah, like tzuk said, none of this CreateWindow slowdown I've identified is going to affect things that aren't calling CreateWindow, which e.g. scrolling in Opera wouldn't do. Maybe it's like the extreme lag I see in API Monitor, which is caused by something else.<br><br><br><strong>tzuk</strong>: Yeah, that's what I meant. <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> Interesting to see your changes... I had been saying toggling Work Offline makes 30 CreateWindow calls, but I now see it's actually 30 PER IE window. So of course <em>that</em> explains why Work Offline slows down much more than e.g. single window opening...<br><br><br>After my post I thought of another OpenWinClass setting I hardly ever think of -- forget about OpenWinClass=* in 4.02 that I've been referencing. Probably not a huge deal or much different (if what I'm asking about is wrong), but you know what performs the same as 4.02's Open=*? OpenWinClass=<strong>#</strong> <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Using Open=# the Work Offline delay with 20 IE windows drops from 5 seconds to under 1 second. Also with 4.05.04: Default settings, IE window opening is 0.28s with 1 window (again, stuff is a lot faster on laptop) and 0.55 with 20 windows. With Open=#, it's 0.25 (exactly what I estimated) and 0.26-0.27 with 20 windows (so basically the same).<br><br>So yeah, Open=# performs and scales wonderfully! It also skips all that "other stuff." <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> (Again, CreateWindow itself is basically like UNsandboxed.)<br><br>The <a href="http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?OpenWinClass" class="postlink">page about OpenWinClass=#</a> says it doesn't "alter" (prefix) class names and "may interfere with some drag-and-drop operations." You really can't make things operate/perform like Open=# and just add back class prefixing and drag-and-drop support??<br><br>Of course prefixing is not an issue and should be a very, very fast operation.<br><br>In other words, are you saying that all that extra stuff per sandboxed window is somehow related to <strong>drag-and-drop support</strong>?? What else doesn't happen/work with Open=#? Which emulation of Win32 hooks? <img class="smilies" src="./../../.https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"><br><br>Obviously I understand if <em>something</em> happens with CreateWindow for the window object being created to support <em>whatever</em> (which shouldn't even be noticeable, so OK). But I don't get why messages to other window handles (but only "top-level" ones, not their children it seems) and repeated identical _wcsicmp/NtDeviceIoControlFile calls...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11108">DR_LaRRY_PEpPeR</a> — Tue Aug 13, 2013 2:08 am</p><hr />

<blockquote><div><cite>tzuk wrote:</cite><strong>pastuch</strong>, I played a bit with Opera 12.16 x64 with probably around 150 tabs.  I was loading tabs in groups of about 25 new tabs every time.  I was seeing minor impact on scrolling speed while new tabs were loading, but it got fast again when the load finished.  Please note that I just installed Opera and started loading tabs.  Did not do any configuration, addons or anything else to Opera.  Do you also have such a "clean" installation?</div></blockquote>In the virtual machine I installed only: the system, all updates, VMware Tools, Opera with default configuration. In the Opera are only two changes - "Show Bookmarks Bar" and the default pages zoom 200%. Then I open the 100-tabs session like that <a href="https://hotfile.com/dl/239200260/b15b1bc/SampleSession.win.html" class="postlink">https://hotfile.com/dl/239200260/b15b1b ... n.win.html</a> . When the Opera is sandboxed in SBIE4.04 the slowdown occurs. All ok when added OpenWinClass=* or with SBIE3.76 <br>My new observation that may be relevant: the degree of scroll-slowdown depends on how I start the scroll - if I use keyboard (arrow up/down, pgup/pgdn) or mouse scroll-whell then slowdown is high but when I use a middle mouse button+mouse move or scrollbar with mouse then the slowdown is not big.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Mon Aug 12, 2013 1:28 pm</p><hr />
