Firefox is the only program I run sandboxed. The Firefox version is 22. I don't know if it matters, but I probably should have mentioned that this is on Windows 7 SP1 x64. Also, I've been using Sandboxie 4.02 for a couple days now and it hasn't had a single copy issue.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4346">0strodamus</a> — Wed Jul 24, 2013 7:14 pm</p><hr />

For me, it was always when copying text. I rarely copy any objects or files from the Sandbox.<br><br>Here's another thing that I observed. This happened rarely to me, but perhaps it is related to the file copying issue that you're seeing. Sometimes in CLCL, instead of showing the actual text on the clipboard, it would show that there was a text object (displayed as (TEXT) in light blue). When that would happen, I could never get any text to copy from Sandboxie no matter how many Ctrl-C operations I performed. When that would happen, I would have to reset the Windows clipboard by running "cmd cmd /c "echo off | clip"" as administrator (I learned that trick from another forum). After running the command, I could copy text, but with all of the issues we've already discussed. Those problems never went away completely no matter what I tried.<br><br>Thanks for staying with this and I hope an answer comes soon so you can move on to other things. I do really do appreciate the support. You and your program are the best!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4346">0strodamus</a> — Wed Jul 24, 2013 2:03 pm</p><hr />

Are you talking about copying text or copying files?  I am testing with CLCL and copying text seems to always work and not cause any problem.  But when I copy files, sometimes they don't make it to the CLCL and the clipboard.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">tzuk</a> — Wed Jul 24, 2013 10:29 am</p><hr />

The behavior you describe sounds very familiar. I do know that if I copied repeatedly, it would eventually make it onto the clipboard. I don't recall if it was consistently twice. I would click Copy (or press Ctrl-C), then my hotkey for CLCL - see that nothing had copied and repeat the process until what I was copying made it to the clipboard. I could reinstall 4.03.01 and test again while paying closer attention if you would like me to.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4346">0strodamus</a> — Tue Jul 23, 2013 9:40 pm</p><hr />

I was wondering if the changes that were made to Sandboxie 4.03.01 beta and later to address copy/paste issues could be made into an optional configuration item. I've already posted regarding issues with copying and pasting that I experienced for the first time starting with 4.03.01. I thought I could live with it, but had no idea how much copying and pasting that I actually do. It was maddening. I reverted back to release version 4.02 and have not had an issue since. I know the problem is related to my use of CLCL and there isn't any way to fix it. However, for me at least, it wasn't broken until version 4.03.01. Would you please consider adding a new Software Compatibility or other setting that could revert the changes made to 4.03.01+ regarding copy/paste if needed for users in my situation?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4346">0strodamus</a> — Sun Jul 21, 2013 6:39 pm</p><hr />
