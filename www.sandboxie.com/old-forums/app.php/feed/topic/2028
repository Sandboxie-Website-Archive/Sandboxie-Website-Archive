Boy, I have Sandboxie so I wouldn't have to contend with all the adware and interjections brought on by trying to download SandboxToys2. If you have a clean site I'd be happy to try it. Not with all the garbage that they're trying to get me to sign up to.

OK, I've finally really used SandboxToys under my Win7 x64 system, and I have been very disappointed because it doesn't work well, mainly because Win7 and Vista are now very picky with the file locations and access rights.  So, I have decided to write a new version from scratch: <strong>SandboxToys2</strong>.<br><br>Please note that SandboxToys2 is designed to run <strong>ONLY under Win7 and Vista (x86 or x64)</strong>.  It cannot be run under XP, 2000 or Win9x.  Under earlier platforms, you should use the old version.<br><br>It's not at all the same program than SandboxToys one.  Although there are similarities, I haven't implemented all features present in v1, as most of them have been officially implemented in Sandboxie itself.  (BTW, thanks Tzuk!)<br><br>Also, the programming language is not Tcl/Tk like in v1, but Autohotkey.  As a consequence, the executable file is much more lite, and some things that were impossible to do with Tcl/Tk (such as icons in the menu) are now possible and implemented.<br><br>SandboxToys2 is mainly a popup menu.  When you click it, it opens a popup menu where you can see the content of the Start Menu, Desktop and QuickLaunch of your sandboxes.  Just select any menu entry to launch the exe or document in the sandbox.  Unlike the regular Sandboxie Start Menu, only the shortcuts that have been installed in the box are visible in the menu.  That means that something must have been installed in the sandbox, and some shortcuts created in the Start Menu, Desktop or QuickLaunch folders, or these menus will not be available.<br><br>There are also several other tools.  You can use SandboxToys2 to create a sandboxed shortcut to any file (residing in the sandbox or not) on your (real) desktop, to launch it easily.  You can also launch the Windows Explorer, the Registry Editor or the Command Prompt, sandboxed or not, to explore or inspect the content of the box.  Additionally, SandboxToys2 has also handy functions to show the content of the box in a listview window, from where you can batch-export any file or create shortcuts to them.  A similar function allows you to see the content of the registry of the sandbox, and export any keys or values to a REG file that you can use to import the values in your real registry.  Finally, there are simple functions to watch the file system and registry changes in any box, and again you can export the modified or created items to your real system.<br><br>I'm too lazy to insert the manual here, but it is included in the archive.<br><br>Download:  <a href="http://www.4shared.com/file/ZOP5GGsc/SandboxToys2.html" class="postlink">http://www.4shared.com/file/ZOP5GGsc/SandboxToys2.html</a><br><br>The source code is included.<br><br>Have fun!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=937">r0lZ</a> — Wed Oct 06, 2010 5:25 am</p><hr />

As I've just installed Sandboxie and SandboxToys under Windows 7 for the first time, I've noticed a little problem.  The first post of this thread explains that you have to copy SandboxToys.exe to your Sandboxie installation folder and double-click it to complete the installation.  Unfortunately, that doesn't work fine under Vista and Win7, as it doesn't have the rights to create the shortcuts in the Start Menu.  So, instead of just double-clicking it, you have to right-click it and run it as administrator.  Same thing when you try to uninstall it.  (The first post has been modified accordingly.)<br><br>I have also fixed the main download link in the first post, as my homepage has changed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=937">r0lZ</a> — Sun Nov 29, 2009 9:02 am</p><hr />

Sorry, ahmahmahm, as I've written above, I visit rarely this forum and I don't receive the email notifications, so I've missed your reply during several months!<br><br>As far as I know, SandboxToys works fine with the current version of Sandboxie.  I've just installed Sandboxie v3.40 and SandboxToys 07.11.04.09 under my new Windows 7, and both work fine.<br><br>The first error message you got might be caused by the fact that something is running in your sandbox doesn't mean that there is something in the Start Menu of the sandbox.  Usually, to have something in the Start Menu, you have to <strong>install</strong> a program in the box, not just run it from outside.  However, if at least one sandbox is not empty, the SandboxToys Start Menu should not refuse to work, as it should at least display its standard menu (with the Tools and Explore sub menus.)<br><br>I have no idea of the cause of the second problem.<br><br>I hope you've sorted out the problem, but if it's still not the case, you should try to repair or uninstall and reinstall SandboxToys.  Also, SandboxToys needs to find where your sandboxes are located, and for that reason, it needs to load the Sandboxie configuration file.  Since it is possible to place it in several different directories, SandboxToys may become confused if you have kept several configuration files in different locations.  Be sure to keep only the configuration file you use really.  Also, verify if SandboxToys has the right to load it!  (This might be a problem in Vista or Win7.)<br><br>Hope this helps!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=937">r0lZ</a> — Sun Nov 29, 2009 8:54 am</p><hr />

Sorry if I haven't replied before.  I do not receive the notifications of this forum by e-mail any more.  I don't know why!?<br><br>I don't like the idea of moving the file instead of copying it.  IMO, it is dangerous to delete it from its original location, at least without a confirmation of the user, especially when you send a system file to a sandbox.  <br>Anyway, when you use the Send To menu, the file is just under the mouse pointer, already selected.  It is easy enough to delete it manually.<br>I agree that moving the file might be faster, but only for large files, and when the source and destination folders are in the same hard disc partition.<br><br>Anyway, thanks for the suggestion, and for your appreciation!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=937">r0lZ</a> — Sun Sep 23, 2007 6:46 am</p><hr />
