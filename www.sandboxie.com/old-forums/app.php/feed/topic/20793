<blockquote><div><cite>cornflake wrote:</cite>Thanks for the quick reply. I need the integrity of the clipboard at all costs. For example that text I copied from the command console was a private key in base64. It was missing all the forward slashes. That was really serious for me. Luckily I still had the open console. I copied again and no problem. I don't want to be an irritant but back to my question, is/was there something in sandboxie that can strip forward slashes out of text? I'd much prefer it until the clipboard issue is resolved that no copy take place or even fill it a short message saying the copy failed. What I cannot have is data that looks like the real data but isn't. This again assuming my problem has something to do with sandboxie, but I don't know. I will be sure to upgrade to 4.18 as soon as I can.</div></blockquote>Sbie does not modify the contents of the clipboard.
