				<div class="content">I have SB 5.22 with Chrome and Win 10 Pro.<br>
<br>
SB was working perfectly when I shut down last night. This morning, none of the tabs opened in Chrome.<br>
<br>
The same tabs open fine with non-SB Chrome. Also, Thunderbird and my bookmarks manager (miTaggedMarks) work OK with SB.<br>
<br>
I uninstalled SB 5.22, and reinstalled. Chrome still does not work with SB.<br>
<br>
I would be grateful for any advice.<br>
<br>
Thanks.</div>

That link eventually solved my problem. Thanks.<br>

To return the favour to other posters who might have this same problem, and to save you having to read a further 26 posts to find the solution, here are the links to the beta software:<br>

I have removed the links since we provide them in the beta section, and they do get updated after a new beta is released (thus, the links you posted will  not be up-to-date once a new beta comes out). I replaced the content with a link to the appropriate section.<br>
<br>
The Google Chrome issue is listed as an announcement and it is visible from any forum (you should be able to see it at the top of the list when entering the Quick Questions section, for example). <br>
Please have a look at this entry prior to reporting a problem, so that you can more efficiently find solutions/related threads:<br>
