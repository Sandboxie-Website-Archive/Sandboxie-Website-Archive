				<div class="content">For people using Sandboxie un-registered, there is a countdown timer.<br>
I accidentally click my sandboxie shortcut sometimes and have to wait for the timer countdown, then let it load the sandboxed browser, before I can close it.<br>
<br>
My feature request is to have a way to cancel/close during or after the countdown, so that the sandboxed browser isn't loaded.<br>
<br>
I understand that a user accidentally aborting sandboxie, would be more of an issue, so the solution would have to make it as impossible as can be, to also prevent that.<br>
<br>
I know I could make a simple launcher program that would have an additional run and cancel button, which if i clicked "Run" it would then be equivalent to clicking the normal shortcut.<br>
<br>
This isn't really a huge deal, and I can't think of an aesthetically pleasing solution that would also prevent accidental aborting. However, sometimes programmers instantly know perfect solutions and if that is the situation, it would be a nice addition. If not, please don't spend hundreds of dollars in development just for my silly request, just for my sake.<br>
<br>
My biggest request, is to keep updating Sandboxie so that it remains working and when I run across a problem, such as crashing, to continue to be able to come to this forum and already have available a newer downloadable beta that fixes the problem.<br>
<br>
Keep up the great work.</div>
