				<div class="content">I know nothing about Unicode... When I open the sandboxie.ini file in notepad, I just see a single string of characters across the top. EmEditor will open it as a readable file, but everything is double-spaced, not at all like I am used to for Windows editing of ini files.. I think if I try to do any editing, I will mess it up when I try and save it...<br>
<br>
I looked at other editors... nothing.. Help on this please</div>

Textpad also opens up the sandboxie.ini file in a double spaced manner.. the same as EM Editor. As stated, notepad opens it with a single scrolling line across the top of the page - unreadable. NONE of my other ini files open in this way...<br>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Paul_K wrote:</cite>Is there any reason why you can't use the Sandboxie Main Window?<br>

Same.. and while we are on the subject.. What is the point of having two sandboxie.ini files? One in windows and one in the home directory. I presume the one in the home directory is a dummy file, as it's date has remained the same as the install, while the windows file is 1000 bytes bigger and has a more recent file date.. leading one to believe that the home directory ini file has no real use or function.</div>

Turning on wordwrap wouldnt help in his situation, all it would do is wrap the text, the problem i see he has, is there is a space between every letter, and it is displayed weird.<br>
<br>
Now i dont know about other ppl here, but i only have 1 Sandboxie.ini file, and that is in the windows dir, and when i goto Configuration-&gt;Edit Configuration it opens the one in the windows dir, so i have to wonder how/why you have 2 ini files? maybe they are conflicting? Anybody else have only 1 ini file or just me? well even if im supposed to have 2, everything is and always has worked fine. Also back on topic, i really dont know what to say, have you tried just editing the ini file anyways in its current condition, what happens?</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>SnDPhoenix wrote:</cite>i really dont know what to say, have you tried just editing the ini file anyways in its current condition, what happens?</div></blockquote> I think I got it worked out.. as to how it all occurred...<br>
<br>
Sandboxie only has one sandboxie.ini file located in windows. Somewhere along the line when I attempted a change, I saved it to the Sandboxie home directory.<br>
<br>
This is the first time I have ever had a single hiccup with EmEditor, a superior text editor. In the case of this particular file, sandboxie.ini, it seems that my text editor, EmEditor,  detects the native unicode encoding of the file and the null characters within, replacing the null characters with spaces. That causes the double-spacing. When I changed the original Sandboxie.ini and saved it to the Sandboxie home directory, I think I preserved the double spacing that the editor  used to replace the null characters, I made a single change in EmEditors default configurations, changing,the "detect unicode signatures and UTF-8" to "Detect All". Right away, the ini file showed as it should...<br>
<br>
Problem solved.. My explanation might be faulty though.. The developer will know how to explain it better than I..</div>

(WindowsRoot)\Sandboxie.ini takes precedence over the alternative location (SandboxieHome)\Sandboxie.ini.  This is described in a bit more detail in the Placement section of the <a href="../index6e14.html?SandboxieIni" class="postlink">SandboxieIni</a> page.<br>

Uh, no he won't.   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">   As far as I understand, this is a glitch introduced by you, then resolved by you, so what can I say about it?</div>
