				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
OK thanks....but I think the idea of an ETA is that you ESTIMATE when it might be ready. I wont hold you to it but it has been 7 months since I started this topic, when you were supposedly working on it, so I would have thought by now you would at least have a rough estimate of how long it will be. Can you at least narrow it down to 2016, 2017 or later?</div>

We have limited resources and other priorities when it comes to SBIE.<br>
If our Enterprise customers on the Invincea side that use the SB container technology (XML instead of INI) (Invincea X) push more and more towards it, then it'll get more of a look. But that has not been the case. The container (SB) is an option in Invincea X.<br>
<br>
It was being worked on, along with Metro apps, but other priorities in the company and for SBIE came up. That was months ago, and I have not been privy to any movement on it.<br>
<br>
As of right now, I don't have an ETA. It hasn't been discussed in a while...this goes for Metro apps. Probably 2017 if at all.</div>

				<div class="content">OK, slightly disappointing on the timescale, but thanks for the info. <br>
<br>
I do understand your resource problems and appreciate your efforts and your needs to prioritize your Enterprise customers. But 2017 is quite a long way off, by which time I might have got used to Edge's "In Private" mode instead. Particularly as Flash is not working in sandboxed IE any more (as per my other topic).<br>
<br>
Edge has improved since its release and I use it almost exclusively now when I don't need a sandboxed browser. While there are still a few features I miss from IE, there are some features in Edge I like that are not in IE and I think the future as far as MS/Win10 is concerned is heading towards Edge.<br>
<br>
So I'll keep my fingers crossed that your Enterprise customers also start asking for Edge support soon, lol.<br>
<br>
All the best.</div>

				<div class="content">Metro support is inevitable because more and more of Win 10 is moving in that direction. It is <span style="text-decoration: underline">possible</span> we may have some support for Metro by the end of the year. It is still in research, so please bear with us.</div>

				<div class="content">Metro Apps (Edge, mail, weather, maps, etc...) are running in Appcontainer (Win10's own "sandboxing" ability), at an Integrity Level one step deeper/safer than the one used by actual sandboxing softwares (which are at Untrusted) . So basically,  asking Sandboxie to support Metro Apps is like asking to reduce the Integrity Level of those apps, hence their security. <br>
<br>
Unless an overall rewrite of the code is made, i don't see implementation of Appcontainer in Sandboxie (and others) anytime soon.<br>
<br>
In the case of Edge, Microsoft is even planning to implement virtualization on it, making sandboxing softwares unneeded to protect it, <br>
<br>
However, sandboxing softwares like Sandboxie will be useful for 3rd party apps/softs.</div>

more like isolated apps that virtual machines, all Metro Apps (and Edge) are "sandboxed" using Appcontainer: <br>

<br>
They are only allowed with very limited rights and only in locations they are supposed to use, nothing else.<br>
<br>
So if you ask Sandboxie to sandbox Edge is like sandboxing a sandboxed apps which is irrelevant. However it would be possible for Sandboxie to add other protection mechanisms to Metro Apps.<br>
If you use Chrome (or chromium-based browsers) , you can even implement Appcontainer on it via a  small tweak, so you increase Chrome security by one step.</div>

Are you able to run two separate (isolated) MS Edge sessions? No, you are not. So it's not irrelevant.</div>

What are you talking about?<br>
<br>
Edge and all Metro Apps (&amp; extensions for them) all run in AppContainer<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb625957.aspx" class="postlink"><strong> Integrity level (IL)</strong></a> , they are built with it, doesn't matter how many sessions you have.<br>
<br>
<img src="../s25.postimg.org/5199pjrbj/Untitled.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
At the moment, Sandboxing softs would reduce Metro Apps' IL (they ran all softs isolated in them at Untrusted IL) , so tell what is the point to add a security soft that would reduce the apps original IL? <br>
<br>
Screenshot shows chrome ran by a sandboxing soft <br>
<br>
<img src="../s25.postimg.org/wz7qblc7j/Untitled.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
The only gains you would have (now) if Sandboxie could isolate Edge will be all the locking options it offers, but to me it is not worth the shot.<br>
However, when Sbie will be able to keep/offer Appcontainer's IL to all softs ran in it , then i will be more than happy to use it with Metro Apps.<br>
<br>
Problem i think, is that Sandboxie will have to set which area is allowed for every existing softs, since Appcontainer principle is that Metro Apps are built to have access only to some specific system's areas , the ones they need to perform properly. Huge work.</div>

				<div class="content">When you run Edge as is it can change things eg Favorites, History, settings etc. If ran via Sandboxie then when you delete the contents of the sandbox these changes are avoided. That's my primary usage of Sandboxie.</div>
