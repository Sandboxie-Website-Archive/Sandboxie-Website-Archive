				<div class="content">Hi. I have several other problems too that couldn't be included in the subject. I'm running the latest version of Sandboxie, Windows 7 64-bit, Firefox 36.0.1, IE 11.0.9600.17691, screen readers NVDA 2014.4, Jaws for Windows version 15. I installed Sandboxie for the first time last night, uninstalled and reinstalled it this morning. First of all and the least problem, the sandbox option has disappeared from all context menus from the desktop or start menu. This didn't happen last night. I configured the accessibility setting in the applications section of the settings for default box, and added all the available configurations under Web Browser in the settings, even Allow direct access to entire Firefox profile folder, but it hasn't fixed the issue. The issue is this. If I run Firefox sandboxed, and there is not already an instance of it running outside, it sets there not responding any time I bring focus to it with the keyboard using NVDA. With Jaws it doesn't do this, but neither will Jaws read the Firefox window. If I run NVDA in the sandbox with it, that doesn't help. Though it did seem to work once last night. But last night I didn't know about the connection between sandboxed and outside instances. The sandboxed NVDA won't read what's in any windows outside the sandbox, and it won't read the firefox window that's inside. The sandboxed Firefox does not, however, go into not responding mode if it has focus with sandboxed NVDA. Internet Explorer simply doesn't start at all in the sandbox, it doesn't matter whether an instance is running outside or not, it does absolutely nothing at all. The only other program I've tried to run so far is notepad, it runs just fine, and screen readers outside can read it's window. But I didn't try to save anything either. I just now tried to run Goldwave audio editor, and as soon as I tried to create a new file, the window disappeared, and I had to terminate the program in the sandbox. Though in that case, I suppose I'll have to give it access to all sorts of folders, it creates it's audio files in temp. I may try that later, though I see no reason to run it sandboxed. Also, the open dialogue under "run any program", only works with Jaws. With NVDA it freezes and the sandboxie window itself will report as not responding. I have to kill NVDA and run Jaws to do anything with it. Thanks for any input.</div>
