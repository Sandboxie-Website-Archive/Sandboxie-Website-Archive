				<h3>Firefox, old Sandboxed Bookmarks disappeared!!</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Tue Mar 20, 2007 5:26 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I just installed the new Sandboxie 2.80 as an upgrade over 2.64 and immediately discovered that all my old bookmarks I had made for Friefox 2.0.0.2 in Sandboxie 2.64 had vanished and was replaced with the bokkmarks from the un-Sandboxed Firefox!!<br>
<br>
It seems the old 2.64 Sandbox kept apart the un-Sandboxed and Sandboxed versions of the Firefox bookmarks, enabling me to have one set of boookmarks when running un-Sandboxed Firefox, and a complete different set of bookmarks for the Sandboxed version of Firefox, and this was GREAT!! However, with the new 2.80 version it seems the Sandboxed version of Firefox always uses the un-Sandboxed Firefoxs' bookmarks.<br>
<br>
For researching reasons I even opened up a Sandboxed instance of Firefox 2.0.0.2 and went into the bookmarks and removed a sample bookmark. When I later run an un-Sandboxed instance of Firefox that very same bookmark was removed from the un-Sandboxed Firefox as well. -NOT GOOD!!<br>
<br>
I am immediately uninstalling the 2.80 version and re-installing the old 2.64. The worst part is that I didnt have a backup of those Sandboxed Firefox bookmarks I precioused and had before upgrading to 2.80 so now I am out in the wilderness trying to probe my deep memory for those many good bookmarks that seem lost forever...... <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad">(<br>

				<div class="content">I restored a System Recovery Point I made three days ago, and there it all was again, every single bookmark I lost to Sandboxie 2.80. -GREAT!!<br>
<br>
Now I'm happy again, and still running Sandboxie 2.64. I kind of like being able to live two separate Windows lifes in to separate worlds on my laptop, one Sandboxed, and one Un-Sandboxed. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
Thank You for a great application (Sandboxie)!<br>

				<h3>I finally got everything to work.</h3>

				<div class="content">I finally got everything to work, but it took me about 4 hours of installing and uninstalling both new and old versions to get a really clean install of the new 2.80 version, and then some research down the directories to finally find where the bookmarks.html file for Firefox was stored this time. I had upgraded Sandboxie a few times in the past too, so the directory structure was a bit messed up, and there were a few instances of Firefox directories and bookmarks.html files to choose from. But finally I found the right one to replace with my old recovered and rescued copy of my precious bookmark file.<br>
<br>
Now everything works just great in every aspect even with the new 2.80 version too! Even better since it seems to work a lot faster and quicker!</div>

				<div class="content">Sorry about that.  It's probably because the layout of the sandbox has changed, so instead of looking for bookmarks in<br>
<br>
\(SandboxRoot)\DefaultBox\Device\HarddiskVolume1\blah\blah\bookmarks.html<br>
<br>
It's in<br>
<br>
\(SandboxRoot)\DefaultBox\drive\c\blah\blah\bookmarks.html<br>
<br>
But I'm glad you were able to figure it out.</div>
