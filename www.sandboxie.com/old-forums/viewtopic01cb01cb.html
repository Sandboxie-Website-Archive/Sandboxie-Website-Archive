vgishmasters, Sandboxie needs our help. Helping them, helps us. Let me explain. A while back, one of the Sandboxie developers told me, fixing issues is the easy part, reproducing problems is whats hard and takes time. Thats were we come into play. If we can help them reproduce an issue by giving them the steps to replicate the problem, then fixing the problem is very likely and takes less time to do it. They cant fix what they cant reproduce. Some issues, the ones that affect every one are easy to replicate but the ones that have to do with specific systems and configurations are not. Thats why it behooves you to give the steps to reproduce your problems and answer the questions when they ask you about your system specs, etc.<br>

				<div class="content">Hi ,I have a S.B alert  <strong>SBIE2205 Service not implemented:  ConsoleInit (C00000D4)</strong><br>
I am using windows 10 1709  16299.19<br>
S.B   5.21.6    64 bit <br>
Firefox 56.0.1<br>
Unfortunately the alert is very random. It appeared with beta version 5.21.4 when i opened firefox, after closing the message it did not reappear.<br>
I updated to 5.21.6   and  several hours after initially opening firefox it appeared again.<br>
The alert may not be solely  related to firefox, it may be that it is the only program i am using sandboxed. <br>
Also i would add, apart from the alert i am experiencing no problems whatsoever.Upon closure the alert does not seem to reappear until reboot.<br>
I am quite happy to just hide the message but thought i would post it, in case it helps in anyway.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I'm using Sandboxie on Fall Creators Update and noticed a strange behaviour with Chrome in Sandboxie.<br>
I've set up that Chrome is forced to run in a specific Sandbox.<br>
Before Fall Creators Update everything was working fine.<br>
After the update I was using the release Version of Sandboxie and after downloading a file I received many errors before restoring the file.<br>
So I switched to the Beta (I think it was 5.21.4 back then) which fixed the errors.<br>
<br>
Everything worked fine for a while but at some time Chrome stopped loading websites in new tabs.<br>
Already running tabs are working fine. When I then try to close Chrome completly it results in Zombie Processes showing up in Task Manager saying the Process chrome.exe belongs to user "ANONYMOUS LOGON".<br>
I can kill the process via Task Manager or use Sandboxies  "Terminate Programs" feature, but one process remains open.<br>
When I try to kill that process via Task Manager it says "Access is denied" and killing it via Sandboxie just does nothing.<br>
I have to restart my computer to get chrome working again as it won't start with that lingering zombie processes.<br>
<br>
I then updated to 5.12.6 and was running that for a while now until the same happened right now.<br>
<br>
I will remove the force Folder feature now and see if it works out of the sandbox (It's hard to reproduce as it just happens randomly).</div>

<strong>Just want to know after the sandboxie 5.22 patch, is everything back to as it should? What I had experienced with 5.20 and latest win10 was that chrome's extension installed in sandbox would be installed too into the original chrome.</strong> I'm still feeling a little paranoid even though with 5.22 everything looks normal.<br>

				<div class="content">Hello maginu ,<br>
<br>
The responses to your first two questions are already covered in the thread. Please read all the posts for more information.<br>
Full support for Windows 10 FCU started with Sandboxie 5.22. So you will need to upgrade to it in order to use that environment. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Can any expert explain what had happened which resulted such "leakage" of chrome with sandboxie?</div></blockquote>
A change in a Windows 10 FCU API caused the issue. It did not only affect Chrome, but any other program that would use that API. Sandboxie had to be updated to process those new changes and properly sandbox them. <br>
The changes were added in Sandboxie 5.21.6 BETA, tested through Sandboxie 5.21.7 Beta, and then added to Sandboxie 5.22 official release.<br>
<br>
If you find any specific issues, please let us know.<br>
