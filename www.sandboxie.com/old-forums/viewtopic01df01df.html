<br>
I just installed Sandboxie 5.14 on a WIn 8.1 x 64 PC (admin account), then I turned on the Guest account and I was able to find Sandboxie under C:\Program Files\Sandboxie<br>
Can you find it there? <br>

Can you try installing the software again (on your main account), now that you have the Guest account activated? <br>
