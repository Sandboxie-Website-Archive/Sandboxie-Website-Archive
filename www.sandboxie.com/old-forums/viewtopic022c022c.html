				<div class="content">When I was new to the computing world, I used to use Virtual Sandbox, the one with the strange robot as the mascot of the program, haha. And even though I used that program for months I still got several infections and strange PC slowdowns, and every time that happened I thought it was my fault for not clearing the sandbox or downloading something bad by accident. It wasn't until when I read Gizmo's report that I found out the program I had been trusting with my PC didn't even make it past the first basic test, which was to actually contain spyware and viruses in its sandbox in the first place. It was then that I found out about Sandboxie but back then, the program did not work for the limited user account which was a NEED for me so I had to hold off for a long time and hoped that the program I was using at least caught some of the spyware from the web. <br>
<br>
After a couple weeks I was fed up with using my obsolete program and decided to try sandboxie again and during that time there was already two new versions out already so I downloaded and install sandboxie again hoping it would do what I needed it to do, haha. Long story short, ever since that day I got rid of that program and used Sandboxie ever since and have had not had an infection since.<br>
<br>
Thank you, developers and and everyone who made Sandboxie the way it is today because the best things in life really are free even if not EVERYTHING about it is actually free, haha</div>
