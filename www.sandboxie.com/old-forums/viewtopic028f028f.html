				<div class="content">Any news about this helpfull function since 2009 request ?<br>
<br>
I use Cinema 4D in a sandbox but it become very huge and now have no choice to delete it and reinstall the software but its time consuming, could you have a better option than the copy paste trick (lot of small files are long to copy) to reinstall software ?<br>
<br>
My suggestion : a snapshot of files and only changed one could be restored is it doable ?<br>
<br>
Thanks and like others, i like to claim that sandboxie is a great tool !</div>

Invincea, inc purchased Sandboxie in 2013...<br>
<br>
as for a "reset"..No, that's something we're not considering.  <br>
<br>
You're looking more into a VM environment, which SBIE is not.<br>
<br>
SBIE sandboxes are temporary storage and should not be used for long term. If you like a program that's running in the sb, and it works well, it should be then installed on your host machine.</div>

				<div class="content">I registered specially for this topic (original question: <a href="viewtopic607d607d.php?f=6&amp;t=22861" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... =6&amp;t=22861</a>).<br>
I have been using something like a reset function for over 2 years now and it works flawlessly:<br>
<br>
Let's say you want a reset function for a sandbox called "web" located in "D:\Sandboxie\web". Sandboxie is installed in "C:\Program Files\Sandboxie"<br>
<br>
Create an empty directory "web_backup" in "D:\Sandboxie\", so now you have tow directories in "D:\Sandboxie":<br>
"D:\Sandboxie\web" and<br>
"D:\Sandboxie\web_backup"<br>
<br>
Create a bat file (ex: "save_web.bat") and place it anywhere.<br>
inside save_web.bat place the contents:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>rmdir D:\Sandboxie\web_backup  /s /q
robocopy /e /copyall D:\Sandboxie\web D:\Sandboxie\web_backup </code></pre></div>

Also create a .bat file "restore_web.bat" with the contents:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>"C:\Program Files\Sandboxie\start.exe" /box:web /terminate
"C:\Program Files\Sandboxie\start.exe" /box:web delete_sandbox
robocopy /e /copyall D:\Sandboxie\web_backup D:\Sandboxie\web </code></pre></div>

Install everything you need inside the web sandbox.<br>
When you are happy with the state of the sandbox right click "save_web.bat" and run as administrator. A cmd window should pop and display some copying files (about a minute or so). When done it closes.<br>
<br>
When you want to revert to the original state, just right click "restore_web.bat" and run as administrator. In a minute the sandbox should be back to the state when it had the new programs installed.<br>
<br>
You can even make modifications: restore -&gt; install additional software -&gt; save.<br>
<br>
I haven't restored a sandbox in more that 100 days and worked perfectly. I just received a message that I should delete the contents as it has been active for more than 30 days. Also, I haven't deleted a sandbox from two years ago, just restored it, and works like new <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

				<div class="content">Thanks a lot for your answer, I think that would be helpfull,<br>
<br>
I've bought sanboxie because i don't want to take time to reinstal softwares on host even if they work correctly in sandboxie because its time consuming.<br>
<br>
In the case of C4D, there is another reason,  its my personnal licence and i don't want to share it with other people in my workplace so when i disconnect my USB Key, I know that none could use it anymore.<br>
<br>
So thanks again mihzaha <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"></div>
