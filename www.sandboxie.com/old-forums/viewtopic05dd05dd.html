Nothing in beta 5.13.1 had ANYTHING directly to do with Steam <br>

Again, we do not test steam games. We know the Steam client works. But that's all we test, and not all the time. That's up to users to test. We have done ZERO Sandboxie updates since before 5.10 as it relates to Steam in almost a year.<br>

Try deleting the contents of your SB and try again, or create a new sandbox.</div>

Not sure what to say, 5.13.1 and Steam here on Windows 7 x64 is still working fine. I just played Grim Dawn for 2 hours in sandboxie :-/ I have noticed that the load time for steam in sandboxie is a lot slower as well but it has been like that forever on my end, not a new thing with 5.13.1 for me.</div>

Interesting. Again, nothing in 5.13..1 that would directly affect that.</div>

				<div class="content">I guess that depends, normally all major X. or X.X changes require a re-activation while X.X.X usually don't so if you were coming from 5.10 or 5.12 that would be normal. If you had the 5.13.1 beta already and re-activated for that previously then it would be odd having to re-activate for the 5.13.2 beta...I guess I'll find out within the next few days if happens to me but atm I'm focused on some Windows 10 tests I have going on in a VM [I'm currently waiting for the latest dism session to finish] so I haven't gotten around to trying the .2 SBIE release on my live OS yet since the copy/paste issue isn't something I've encountered so far but 5.13.1 has been great on my system though I do still have time to troll forums :-/</div>

Question, you brought up a good point about drag and drop. We know this seemed to work before, but it appears, even with the latest fix, it doesn't. Copy/paste works, but if you have any recollection of using that in the past, let us know? We're all trying to question that too. We know it did work, at least we keep telling ourselves that.</div>

Drag/drop from a sandboxed windows explorer certainly does not work with recent versions of Sandboxie.  For some reason, I also seem to recall that it did work at some point in the past, but I can't reproduce it - in fact, I just tested as far back as Sandboxie version 3.20 (released around 2007) and drag/drop does not work even with that.  I actually never use drag/drop, favouring the mouse right click copy/cut and paste and keyboard Ctrl-x/c/v commands over it.  But perhaps I've always used that because drag/drop has never worked?<br>
<br>
EDIT: in my opinion, I wouldn't spend too much effort looking into it - it doesn't significantly affect usability/convenience, given there are several other ways to "drag/drop" as above.  Furthermore, my fear is that if something like this is fiddled with, we'll start to see "bypasses" like this again (these were some interesting POCs that froze the mouse and terminated processes outside the sandbox, despite the POCs being run sandboxed etc):<br>
