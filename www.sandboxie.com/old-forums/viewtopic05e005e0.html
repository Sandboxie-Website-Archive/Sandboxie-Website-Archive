				<div class="content">So here's something I came across last month. I'm going to modify a PM I <em>sent</em> someone else and try to expand upon it so that others know what happened.<br>
<br>
When I was using SbieCtrl and selecting Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Edit Configuration I would see a <em>cmd window pop</em> up but the <span style="text-decoration: underline">sandboxie.ini was never opened in notepad</span>. It went by in a flash so I didn't know what was going on at first.<br>
<br>
I eventually used procmon and saw that instead of launching notepad, sbiectrl was instead using a key from<br>
HKCR\*\shell\runas<br>
which was a key I added a long time (1 year+) ago for taking ownership of files
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\runas]
@="Take Ownership"
"NoWorkingDirectory"=""
"Icon"="\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\TO.ico\""

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\runas\command]
@="cmd.exe /c takeown /f \"%1\" &amp;&amp; icacls \"%1\" /grant administrators:F"
"IsolatedCommand"="cmd.exe /c takeown /f \"%1\" &amp;&amp; icacls \"%1\" /grant administrators:F"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\runas]
@="Take Ownership"
"NoWorkingDirectory"=""
"Icon"="\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\TO.ico\""

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\runas\command]
@="cmd.exe /c takeown /f \"%1\" /r /d y &amp;&amp; icacls \"%1\" /grant administrators:F /t"
"IsolatedCommand"="cmd.exe /c takeown /f \"%1\" /r /d y &amp;&amp; icacls \"%1\" /grant administrators:F /t"</code></pre></div>

Instead of opening the sandboxie.ini via notepad, it was taking ownership of the ini via that key!<br>
<br>
The Why:<br>
I finally tracked the cause down to another key (HKCR\exefile\shell\runas) for which I had removed read/write rights to (say that 10x fast), I can't say for sure but I think it was when I started restricting runas, 'runas other user' and 'run as admin' from the context menu for L/SUAs.<br>
<br>
The problem/bug (maybe):<br>
If it couldn't read the key shouldn't it just do nothing instead of randomly using another key in its place or does it just fallback to another runas (* ='s all after all) it finds? Maybe it's a quirk with the way windows interacts with the registry keys and some type of fallback but for the life of me I can't figure out for sure why it happened.<br>
<br>
<strong>Why does removing read/write access to an <span style="text-decoration: underline">EXE</span> key mess with the way sandboxie opens the <span style="text-decoration: underline">INI</span>?</strong><br>
<br>
My workaround for now was to undo the read/write restrictions but I don't really think that's a suitable long-term fix either. I guess if it's Windows related there's not much that can be done and I'll have to live with it...but I'd like to know if that's the case!<br>
