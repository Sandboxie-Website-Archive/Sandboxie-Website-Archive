				<div class="content">I need to specify all my browsers, and let sandboxie run.  So, when I run computer, I don't need family to log me out, and they can surf the internet, closing and opening browsers, downloading and executing attachments, with no harm of my computer and no knowledge of sandboxie.<br>
<br>
I ran sandboxie for half hour and nothing except stuff I purposefully ran was sandboxed.  Worse, I was able to download and install 7zip.exe when browser was sandboxed. <br>
<br>
<br>
Am I missing something?</div>

"Rollback" software is a fool. They can not rollback certain malwares and system remains infected after reboot.</div>

				<div class="content">I will look into those rollback programs.<br>
<br>
I would love to think that the program has what I am looking for, and I posted in wrong forum.  But no one is hinting that I can really sandbox in my family.  My first impressions of the program said to me that it would be great to sandbox programs if I launch from sandboxie---something they will not do when I am not home.<br>
<br>
I do have virtualbox with crunchbanglinux as guest.  But everything has a 1 to 1.5 second delay.  Even with Midori and a total 130 meg of 1 gig ram, You click tabs and wait, you click into address bar and wait to see cursor, you click links and wait before it thinks to start loading.  They hate it, as do I.   If I were really technical, xen look surprising, except not too compatible with xp--which has some mission critical aps that run when I am away, and have no linux counterparts (moreover, linux is not compatible with my printer, modem, or video card).</div>
