Scroll approximately halfway down on Sandboxie's home page and you'll see a table titled "Stop a Wide Variety of Malware from Infecting Your Machines..."</div>

You miss tons of malware variants but there is no point listing them as generically Sandboxie protects the system from all them. And there is also not much point doing videos from many different malwares because Sandboxie will work in the same manner for all them when it comes to protect machine from infection.<br>
<br>
It would be more interesting a video where it is showed how to protect a system with Sandboxie in order to prevent information leaks. With default configuration (DefaultBox), a malware will not infect them system but it will be able to send passwords from FTP clients, mail, or whatever.<br>
<br>
The video could be like a "before" and "after" where it is showed how a malware can send personal information before changing default settings and how the malware is stopped in its tracks afte changing settings.</div>

What would be your advise Buster besides Closed File Path?</div>

If you mean to protect personal files and folders, in addition to using Close/Write File Path access, I separate programs from each other as much as I can  by using separate sandboxes. In each sandbox, I only allow the necessary programs to run and/or connect. For example, in my PDF sandbox, only Foxit can run and since Foxit doesn't need internet access to work, I block internet access to all programs in that sandbox. In every sandbox that I make, I try to strike a balance between usability and security, never making any sandbox uncomfortable to use.<br>

I agree.  I like to test lots of software in their own sandboxes.  Initially, I relied solely on ClosedFilePath as the way to protect the content in My Documents.  But occasionally I discovered that some of the software I was testing in their respective sandboxes needed to create files in My Documents in order to properly work.  Blocking access to My documents via ClosedFilePath caused the test software to crash.  WriteFilePath (Write-Only Access) fixed those problems.  Now I exclusively use that setting.  Best I can tell, it successfully protects my private stuff in My Documents just as well as the Blocked Access setting did.</div>
