				<div class="content">I've been lucky so far since I continue to use SBIE in my sandbox (WinXP).   The newer Windows OSs  have a heck of a lot of other things going on with them and I can see this being a tremendous burden to address every issue there may be out their or request desired by the many enthusiasts of SBIE.   Not sure if open sourcing SBIE will ever be in the cards, but it would possibly address the support issues.   I know Buster and many others here are true gurus and have more then contributed to SBIE in there own ways.   I'm still just a true believing end user.   When SBIE no longer exist (God forbid), I'll go full Linux for my sandbox.   I still more then prefer XP since it doesn't have near the overhead as any of the other Windows OSs and I'm still very comfortable with the interface, but I've toyed with other OSs too.     Still, good thread to have.  Folks need to spiel; trust me, I know that too.   lol<br>
<br>
Just glad Invincea hasn't gotten rid of SBIE for all those that still use it.   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

The invincea.com links from sandboxie.com and the sandboxie.com links from invincea.com were removed because they were causing a lot of confusion for customers.  They are 2 different products for 2 different customers.</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Buster,<br>
<br>
Thanks for writing, and thanks for being such a dedicated Sandboxie user over the years.  I’ve read through your threads on Invincea’s support of Sandboxie, and the team and I have discussed them at length.  At Invincea we know that our customers (both paid and free) are our best asset, and the last thing we want is to disappoint you when it comes to support.  The truth is that the Sandboxie user community has grown to be much larger than when Ronen was running it, having been downloaded millions of times over the past year and with almost a half million active users as of last month.  It was downloaded 247,000 times just last month!  While I read your critical comments about support with great interest, I suspect that we’d be experiencing far more serious growing pains if we were still relying on just one person to support and develop Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
Just to avoid any confusion, Sandboxie is not just important to Invincea, it is *critical* to us.  Sandboxie isn’t just a free product that we give away, it's a core piece of technology inside of our successful commercial product that is running in over 25,000 enterprises worldwide.  We have enjoyed great success because of it, and are committed to Sandboxie and the Sandboxie community, and will remain so in the future.  <br>
<br>
Having said that, I’m really glad that you were so vocal about your concerns in this forum.  The resulting conversations that you sparked inside of Invincea have made us realize that the rapid growth of the Sandboxie community now requires us to hire a full-time support engineer that will be dedicated to our free products, Sandboxie and Invincea Research Edition.  Curt has done a great job supporting all of you up until this point, but the community has grown so much that Curt cannot be both developer and support engineer any longer.  The Sandboxie community deserves dedicated support, and that’s what we’re going to provide.  <br>
<br>
We are actively looking for this engineer now, and anticipate having them onboard, trained, and actively supporting you in the next few months.  I want all of you in the Sandboxie Forum to know that these are very exciting times at Invincea.  We’re growing faster than ever, releasing a new product next month, and generating great value for our customers by protecting them against advanced threats.  We will continue to give Sandboxie the support and development attention it needs, just like we do with our commercial customers. We’re happy to have all of you as part of the Invincea family, and appreciate your continued input.<br>
<br>
Norm<br>
Chief Operating Officer, Invincea</div>
