				<div class="content">I have been recommending Sandboxie to my customers now for several years and quite a few have purchased your product.<br>
I have recently had one person whom I convinced to use Sandboxie since Feb. 2013, who's computer crashed recently.<br>
We wrote Support from the email originally used, requesting help with reactivating on a his replacement computer.<br>
<br>
"<span style="color: #0000BF">To whom it may concern,<br>
I purchased Sandboxie several years ago. Since then my computer crashed and I have had to purchase another one.<br>
Unfortunately, my key was saved on the old computer and I cannot access it.<br>
I need to ask you for a copy to reactivate Sandboxie on my new computer please.<br>
I am not sure which email I used to sign up with as I have two of them.<br>
It was either under <em>(edited)hotmail.com</em> or  <em>(edited)gmail.com</em><br>
Let me know what other information you would need also.<br>
Thank you,<br>
<em>Name removed</em></span>"<br>
<br>
<br>
This is the response we get:<br>
"<span style="color: #800000">Thank you for your email.<br>
<br>
Technical Support is not provided via email. Technical Support is provided in the User Support Forums here: <a href="index.html" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/</a><br>
<br>
<br>
If you have recently updated your Windows OS (as of Tues Oct 14th) you may be a victim of the Microsoft patch that has broken Sandboxie with web browsers. That can be fixed by downloading the most recent Beta version here: <a href="viewtopiccd44cd44.html?f=54&amp;t=21855" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 54&amp;t=21855</a><br>
<br>
<br>
License related questions will be responded to via email.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
HUH??  This is the approach by the New Sandboxie Owners? The request was ABSOLUTELY about an activation issue and according to the FAQ, we followed procedure by emailing support.<br>
Does this mean we are out of luck for getting support for activation problems for a product that was already paid for?<br>
If this is true, then I will not be recommending Sandboxie to anyone anymore.<br>
<br>
Any info would be appreciated. Thanks</div>

				<div class="content">gumper, I would try support again. Perhaps the person in charge at the time you sent the mail was out or something like that and you got an standard response back. <br>

				<div class="content">OK then, thanks for the update.<br>
It didn't make sense and glad to know they were not blowing us off. <br>
Ill try back Monday.<br>
<br>
Ill admit my imagination was thinking "well this is what its come to after TZUK left?"  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad"> .<br>
<br>
Sorry and Thanks again.</div>

				<div class="content">I would think having an auto responder on while I was gone would handle 90% of the questions we have had recently via email (most new users (and seasoned SBIE users)  don't know about the forum, or how technical support is handled)<br>
<br>
Otherwise, The email would have just lingered until Monday. Which, IMHO would have been worse.<br>
<br>
 Normally, that responder is on M-F 0800-1700 and on the weekends. (If I remember to turn it on... <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">  )<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what Ronen would have done, but I'm fairly certain he kept technical questions in the forum and license / purchase questions via email. I believe we carried that over.</div>

				<div class="content">Sorry I intended on updating this yesterday.<br>
We got the key sent to use and my customer is happy. All is well again.<br>
<br>
Makes sense now about the auto respond.<br>
We're good.<br>
Thanks.</div>
