<br>
That thread is about the problem that the sandbox is not emptied on shutdown when the option "delete the sandbox when the last program ends" is activated.<br>
<br>
I do not want to empty the sandbox when no programs are running in it.<br>
<br>
I only want it to be emptied when I shutdown the system - not before.<br>
<br>
But I already found the solution:<br>
<br>
I made a cmd script "DeleteSandBox.cmd" with the command RMDIR /s /q "C:\Sandbox\Administrator\DefaultBox"<br>
And this cmd file is executed at system startup in the Windows Task Scheduler.<br>
<br>
This way I have always a clean sandbox at the start of a new windows session.</div>

				<div class="content">The problem with having such an option is that Windows will display the screen asking the user to terminate running programs (Sandboxie) before windows shuts down. Those who enable it will think that Sandboxie is making windows unresponsive when in fact its not the case ofcourse.<br>
<br>
Deleting a sandbox on startup seems to be a better solution for the potential issue mentioned above. If its easy to implement, I guess its a nice bonus, but not really needed.</div>

Agree it would be nice if it was a built in option ... <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> <br>
<br>
Thanks for your tip/workaround.<br>
<br>
I'll give it a try!<br>

				<div class="content">Bad luck, it did not work. Can't figure out how to do this.<br>
As said, it should be an option within Sandboxie, instead of users trying to figure this out themselves.<br>
I am not familiar with scripts.<br>
<br>
I created a text file<br>
containing just 1 line<br>
<br>
RMDIR /s /q "G:\Sandbox\MyName\DefaultBox" <br>
saved it as: DeleteSandBox.cmd<br>
<br>
Then went on with the steps outlined in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Schedule-a-task" class="postlink">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/wind ... ule-a-task</a><br>
and pointed to above file.<br>
<br>
Nothing happened.<br>

				<h3>Related: Stop all programs and delete all on Sandbx exit</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Mon Jan 21, 2013 2:30 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>XCLN</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Hi<br>
<br>
Is there a simple way to implement this feature?  Basically to use Sandboxie as a safe browser with no memory after each Snadboxie exit, not each windows restart. <br>
<br>
I know it is sort of a shame not to use its full capabilities, but sometimes simple is safer ..  I'd set the default that way, and if I wanted to save some downloads etc. would start the non simple version.<br>
<br>
Right now it is a pain to do this manually, stop all running processes, delete all contents .. <br>
<br>
thanks if anyone has worked out the details and can provide a short how to (scripts, shortcuts, commands  options .. )</div>

If you don't use any browser settings that will result in items being saved out of the sandbox, then everything will be deleted in the sandbox when the programs end.<br>
You might want to turn off Immediate Recovery so as not to be prompted when some file appears in one of the Quick Recovery folders, if you don't plan on saving anything out of the sandbox.<br>
You could also delete all folders listed as Recovery Folders, if you don't want to be bothered with anything that might have been saved or downloaded into those folders.<br>
<br>
If you start a sandboxed session by using your browser, and other programs are started that use the same sandbox, it's possible that one of those other programs might continue to run - preventing auto delete from initiating.<br>
You can add those .exe programs to a list of Lingering Programs or you can set your browser's .exe program as a Leader Program, and ending it will end all other programs that are using that same sandbox.<br>
<br>
All of the above are listed as settings under Sandbox Settings, for each sandbox.</div>
