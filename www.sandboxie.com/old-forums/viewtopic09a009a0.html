				<div class="content">Hi.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to say this is a great app! I can't believe it's just one guy writing this.<br>
<br>
I haven't got iTunes working yet which is what stops it being a perfect app (I've posted a help request elsewhere) but it's certainly up there. I'm very pedantic about keeping my OS clean and thanks to Sandboxie I can now sleep at night.<br>
<br>
I've read lots of posts complaining about lack of 64-bit support and Windows 7 support (well the RC has been out 8 days!). So I thought I'd redress the balance by saying that I was running the 64-bit Windows 7 RC but I've gone back to Vista 32-bit just to use Sandboxie. And it's well worth it!<br>
<br>
Many thanks and keep up the good work.<br>
<br>
Mike</div>
