				<div class="content">Hi!<br>
<br>
Because Firefox latest update now only gives me blank pages, I re-installed the Epic browser, and it give me normal pages, and gets sandboxed it looks like (yellow frame, red dots). But I get this every time: SBIE2203.<br>
<br>
So I installed Chrome to see if things would be different, and it also gets sandboxed it seems as described for Epic, but the same SBIE2203 panel appears.<br>
<br>
Any way to solve this?</div>

What else is being reported with the 2203 error? You can just use the copy&amp;close function of the alert box then paste it here.<br>

Any Anti-Virus or other security products at play?<br>
<br>
As far as the new firefox having blank pages, this is a known issue that has a workaround, namely disabling the new multi-process option:<br>

Latest SB version.<br>
Windows 8.1.<br>
<br>
As for SBIE2203, that does not appear when I disable my HitmanPro Alert3 browser protection. So that's the culprit I just found out. But I can leave its keystroke encryption active.<br>
<br>
Having both SB and Alert3 is overdoing it anyway I think... too paranoid.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed"> <br>
<br>
My MBAM and Emsisoft AM don't interfere.<br>
<br>
I'll try the fix for Firefox' blank pages you offered when I feel the urge to install Firefox again.... but getting used to Epic and Chrome for now.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"><br>

				<div class="content">For months I have been using Alert again and there were no issues with Sandboxie any more. Until a few days ago with the latest Alert update. Now I get the SBIE2203 warning again. <br>
HitmanPro sais it's a Sandboxie issue, that Alert does what it should. So I want to bring it up here once more. Be it for the last time. Without blaming anyone, especially since I don't know about these technical things.<br>
<br>
By unticking "Local Privilege Mitigation" via "Risk Reduction" &gt; "Process Protection" Alert stops showing a warning page in front of the webpage. But SBIE2203 still shows up.<br>
<br>
Fact is that I've enjoyed utilizing SBIE sinds 2005 or 6, and am not about to give that up. Plus I already have Emsisoft AM's protection.<br>
<br>
So if Sandboxie can fix this issue, fine. Otherwise I can still utilize the HitmanPro scanner and its extra protection from the paid version I still have 6i3 days for which was included in Alert. Or keep using Alert and simply click the SBIE2203 panel away. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?:" title="Question"></div>

Is the hitman pro alert template enabled? <br>
<br>
From your previous posts, it seems that you have several security programs installed and running at the same time. Do Firefox/Chrome work fine outside Sandboxie? <br>
<br>
Please provide this info: (including full error messages , program versions and repro steps)<br>

And the output of the resource access monitor (be sure to use a new Sandbox with default settings, and that the HitmanPro template is enabled globally):<br>
<a href="../ResourceAccessMonitor.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/ResourceAccessMonitor</a><br>
To paste the output of the resource access monitor,  copy/paste it in your response, highlight it and click on the "&lt;/&gt;" button in the forum in order to format it.<br>

If they made a change (via update) and the issue came back, chances are this is on their end.  <br>

It looks like I'm the only person with this issue, or maybe just one of two, as I saw also someone else post about this here and on the Wilders Security forum. At first I though this issue would affect many Sandboxie users, so also on behalf of them I posted about this here now. <br>
But if it would be just me, it's not worth the trouble for Sandboxie. I already had removed Alert and used the HitmanPro scanner only, and made a system backup of that, as everything was working fine again. But now my bookmarks in Chrome don't stick any more, like for this thread, even though Bookmarks direct access is checked as before in my Sandboxie Settings for Chrome. I removed that ExtraBox as this bookmark issue came up right after making that one. But still the bookmark I made for this tread is gone as well as another one I made just for testing. <br>
<br>
So I'm going to reset my laptop using that system backup made without Alert on it. Hopefully that solves all these issues for me.<br>
I'm sorry to have even brought it up. <br>
<br>
HitmanPro Alert is checked on the Software Compatibility list.<br>
Chrome, IE11 and Epic work fine outside the sandbox. Not using Firefox any more.<br>
Windows 8.1<br>
Sandboxie 5.22 (64-bit)<br>
Chrome 62.0.3202.94 (64-bit) (My default browser. If the issue with this one is solved I assume it is for the other two as well. But I hardly use those, so it does't matter to me.)<br>
HitmanPro Alert Version 3.7.1 build 723<br>
Emsisoft AntiMalware latest version.<br>
Malwarebytes Premium 3.1.2<br>

SBIE2203 Failed to communicate with Sandboxie Service:  *GUIPROXY_00000001 - chrome.exe [FF000000]<br>

Looks like I get different results using my default box. So at your requestI made an "ExtraBox" -first time ever- not sure my settings are in default mode in the ExtraBox. But here it is from that one:<br>

Sometimes everything works normally even with all settings on Alert checked. Then the next time I open my browser I get the SBI2203 message again. At other times I get also the warning panel from Alert, and made a screen shot of the technical details on that panel. I can post that here too if you like.</div>

				<div class="content">PS:<br>
Now that using a backup I have restored my system to the state it was in after removing Alert and keeping the HitmanPro scanner, also my bookmarks stick again in Chrome. (While trying out different things in Sandbox Settings to solve the Alert issue must I have messed up the bookmark setting. Although direct access looked still enabled. But that messing up was only after making the backup, so it was not in the backup.) <br>
Because of the restoration I lost the screen shots of the Alert panel with technical details. For myself I'm happy everything is working again just fine, so I wouldn't re-install Alert again to make that screen shot one more time. But if there are many others who have this issue and it would be helpful for Sandboxie to solve it for them, I'm willing to install Alert again just for that reason -making a screen shot of Alert's technical report- and making that available to Sandboxie, and then remove Alert again. (If the issue would be solved I can always install Alert again of course. But just for myself I wouldn't bother with solving this Alert/Sandboxie issue any more.)</div>

I have no Sandboxie/HitmanPro problems. They work fine together. But Alert is a much more extensive and intrusive version that the maker of HitmanPro -Surfright- later developed. Alert and Sandboxie worked well, until the latest Alert update recently. (Although in the past there were issues, but in the latest version they were solved for quite some time, until the recent update.)<br>
<br>
I emailed that to Surfight, and now it's a question of when they fix it Ronny from Surfright told me. And he advised me to check this thread out:<br>
<a href="https://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads/hitmanpro-alert-support-and-discussion-thread.324841/" class="postlink">https://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads ... ad.324841/</a><br>
<br>
