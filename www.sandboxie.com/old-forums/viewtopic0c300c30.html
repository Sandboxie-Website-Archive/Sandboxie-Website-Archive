				<h3>Socks 4/5 proxy support</h3>

				<div class="content">Instead of allowing apps to either access or not access net, a third option in which traffic is funneled to a socks 4/5 proxy.<br>
<br>
This particular subject, or subjects loosely related, have be brought up approximately 5 times, according to a search on the forums for "proxy". See picture below..<br>
<br>

<br>
Neither the arguments already presented, or the replies, have dealt a convincing argument as to why or why not this idea would be ideal for Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
Tzuk in all fairness has stated that:<br>
<br>
<img src="../i54.tinypic.com/jpkcxe.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
But on the flip side, also in fairness, Sandboxie has already taken on a role if internet filter / firewall with the following options:<br>
<br>
<img src="../i52.tinypic.com/x50rk.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
So the idea which I am presenting is -- from the above screen, instead of allowing programs to have either internet, or no internet -- then a third option could be present, which is redirect to proxy, and which would look like this:<br>
<br>
<img src="../i51.tinypic.com/23vahj8.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
To say that this is out of the scope of Sandboxie cannot be entirely accurate, since Sanboxie already has taken the step of commanding which applications are allowed internet access.<br>
<br>
An argument counter to mine could be that neither I, or others making requests, are computer programmers who are working on Sandboxie. So in theory, no one other than Tzuk can say if this idea is easy or difficult to implement, and if it will be worth the effort. It just seems  to me though, that since Sandboxie has already taken control of the applications' internet potential, then its a very small step to take to add a simple third option (than either on or off), which allows a traffic redirect to either HTTP or SOCKS proxy.<br>
<br>
There are apps out there which are dedicated to performing this task alone (<a href="http://www.proxifier.com/" class="postlink">proxifier</a>), yet they do not integrate with Sandboxie as well as a pre-integrated solution might .<br>
<br>
I hope dearly that this idea is received to an open mind, and a fresh perspective. For me this would make Sandboxie the ultimate app, and even worth paying for again (just paid my first copy today, after a month with the trial).</div>

				<div class="content">Sandboxie filters Internet access by allowing or blocking access to Internet devices, not Internet IP addresses.<br>
<br>
Think about it this way, suppose programs had to open a file C:\INTERNET.TXT as a first step before being able to do any kind of Internet communications, so Sandboxie just blocks access to this file.<br>
<br>
That is not at all the same as actually being a firewall and dealing with the networking/Internet parts of Windows.</div>

				<div class="content">Well, when you explain it like that, it makes perfect sense.. thank you for making the time to reply.. very much appreciated.<br>
<br>
Actually, some of the 3rd party proxy apps <span style="text-decoration: underline">do</span> integrate better than I had first thought.. So I dare say it can still work out nicely.<br>
<br>
Sandboxie is the greatest app.. thank you for bringing it to where its at today.</div>
