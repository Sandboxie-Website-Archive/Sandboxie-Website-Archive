				<div class="content">Greetings,<br>
<br>
I'm trying to protect my home PC from attachments, but am very new to using a sandbox. It's an automated application so it's not run from my browser. Not sure what the best way to use this product is.<br>
<br>
User uploads file (text or Excel) to website.<br>
Uploaded file sent to VirusTotal for scanning.<br>
Uploaded file emailed to Gmail account as attachment. <br>
<br>
home PC<br>
Perl program1 opens Gmail, finds the attachment, writes it to disk.<br>
Perl program2 does data processing which includes MySQL DB<br>
Perl program3 emails output file to final destination<br>
<br>
Please pardon my ignorance if I should "just put everything in the sandbox," but seems like I should be isolating all this as much as possible. I may be over-thinking all this though. The perl progs have been packed so no need to call the interpreter.<br>
<br>
Any advice on how best to do this?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance<br>
<br>

<br>
If the application is invoked via a Sandboxed application, it will then be Sandboxed. Keep in mind that the purpose of Sandboxie is to isolate applications to avoid making any changes to your host (unless explicitly allowed).<br>
<br>
If the application is invoked in a different manner, you may need to either run it Sandboxed or use the paid features (Force Process) in order to force it to launch Sandboxed every time it opens. <br>
Here's more information:<br>

<br>
My concern is that the attachment could have/be a virus, which could then make changes to my home PC when I do the data processing. <br>
<br>
The price of your product is very reasonable. I would be happy to buy it.  Would it make the most sense, as far as safety and using your product, to just download the attachment to a "forced folder" to isolate it from the rest of my system? What I'm trying to do is download a potentially dangerous file to my home PC, open it, read the contents and do some processing (safely).<br>
<br>
Any further advice would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks again.<br>

If you launch the application Sandboxed, its contents (including downloaded files) will be stored in the Sandbox. You can then, use recovery options to move the files to your host: <a href="../RecoverySettings.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/RecoverySettings</a><br>
<br>
I don't know exactly how your program works but you can try everything I posted, except for the Force Folder/process features with the free version:<br>
<a href="../DownloadSandboxie.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/DownloadSandboxie</a><br>
<br>
Regarding Forced Folder, that could work as well. However, read the full entry for exceptions:<br>
<a href="../ForceFolder.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/ForceFolder</a><br>
<br>
If you are planning on dealing with malware, be sure to review these:<br>

				<div class="content">You could always open your Start menu - click on Sandboxie - and from the drop down menu you then click on "Run Windows Explorer Sandboxed" and continue on as usual. That way anything you do is within Sandboxie. <br>
You can specify that only Perl can run and/or access the Internet. That way if something unwanted tries to open or call out, it will be blocked.<br>
<br>
Fyi -- In Windows 7 you can Pin "Run Windows Explorer Sandboxed" to your desktop and it shows up as a sandboxed "My Computer" icon.</div>

I'm just paranoid about willingly downloading files, uploaded to my website, which could be dangerous without doing everything I can to protect myself. I would be kicking myself if I didn't use a sandbox as well and some virus got through my frontline defenses (i.e. VirusTotal's 40+ AV vendor scans) as unlikely as that could be.<br>
<br>
Looks like I've got to read up on all this to see how best to implement it.<br>
<br>
Thanks again!<br>
