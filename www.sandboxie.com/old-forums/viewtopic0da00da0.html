				<h3>Sandboxie Support Update</h3>

				<div class="content">Greetings all,<br>
<br>
We are making some changes regarding how are going to be addressing Sandboxie issues for the time being.<br>
<br>
Ideally, we are aiming at posting a new Beta or Release version every month. <br>
Please find the beta versions <a href="viewforumad01ad01.html?f=43/" class="postlink"> here</a><br>
<br>
Every post will receive a tech support answer as usual, and it will be troubleshot as much as possible in order to find a workaround/solution. If no solution is found at the tech level, the problem will get escalated to development and will be addressed based on its category (as provided below).<br>
<br>
1 – Primary Focus: OS problems / Security bypasses. Any issue that prevents Sandboxie from properly working on a given OS (XP being at the bottom of the list, and Windows 10 at the top. Vista is not officially supported), or any security issues will be prioritized.<br>
<br>
2 –Secondary Focus: Major applications - <br>
Browsers -&gt; Firefox, IE, Chrome (other browsers will be considered based on issue severity/dev availability).<br>
MS Office Applications -&gt; Word, Excel, Outlook (other Office applications based on issue severity).<br>
To an extent, issues with Antivirus Software that cannot be fixed using a workaround. (See <a href="viewtopica726a726.html?f=11&amp;t=21539#p111707/" class="postlink"> this thread</a> &amp; <a href="../KnownConflicts.html" class="postlink"> the Known Conflicts Section</a> for AV compatibility).<br>
<br>
3 – Anything else, including Feature Requests, will be reviewed and logged as usual. However, no ETA will be provided for a fix. This means that we will be aware of the issue, we will try to provide technical support as much as possible, but if the problem requires dev time it may not receive a solution right away. <br>
<br>
We thank everybody for your patience and support.</div>
