				<div class="content">I wanted to buy it, but I don't understand why I have to give all my private data to just receive a digital key. I'm sorry but my private data are more important than your profit!<br>
If I buy something in a physical shop, I don't have to give any of my private data. If I buy something concrete in an online shop logically I have to give an address, where to ship the product. But if I buy something digital in a online shop, they don't require any of my private data!<br>
This is very invasive in the private sphere, there isn't any need of the private data, it's just another way to collect private data and store them in a data base for other purpose, which haven't nothing to do with the purchase!<br>
I bought many digital goods online and no one asked my private data, because they don't need them, a simple payment with the credit card and the digital goods can be downloaded or received per email.<br>
If you really want to boost the selling, use an online shop, which is less intrusive in the private sphere of your potential costumers.</div>
