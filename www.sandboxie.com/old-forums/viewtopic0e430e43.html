They haven't had a maintenance since almost a week ago. Try launching the game from the installation folder using the NDLAUNCHER instead of opening it through Steam. If that still fails you can try and create a shortcut to NINEDRAGONS.EXE with the launch option "-E2TCOUFTTVR06VUQ9580EQB3XU" without quotes. It will launch the game, but you may end up with an error about invalid data in your files. GameGuard should have successfully loaded by then however so all the problems I've been having should also happen for you at that point.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi plastic00, <br>
<br>
The launchers do not work at all at this point, but your suggestion to add the launch option to ninedragons.exe triggered nprotect. <br>
Unfortunately, I was not able to reproduce the problem when opening links from Steam (Chrome is forced in the Sandbox). <br>
<br>
I tried both with Sandboxed and non-Sandboxed nprotect + Forced Chrome . Links open fine, no error message is displayed. <br>
<br>
If you have any other steps that I may be missing, please let me know. <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>

				<div class="content">Since you have said that you're not receiving the same errors I decided to download the latest Chrome installer and update Sandboxie to 5.18. I installed Chrome again, but didn't bother to uninstall Chrome beforehand. I have also deleted my browser sandbox, and created a new one with "None" as the copied settings. I set up the forced programs using the "&lt;ChromePrograms&gt;" instead of the "chrome.exe" that shows up inside of the recently used programs list. I previously also had direct access or full access to my Chrome folder, but I've not set anything currently for either direct or full access. For some reason I am unable to apply the settings when I select "&lt;ChromePrograms&gt;" from either Full or Direct Access tabs.<br>
<br>
With all of this done, strangely no errors occur and Sandboxie doesn't get forced to exit any running programs when GameGuard initializes. I am also able to open links perfectly fine now from Steam and Skype whilst the game is open. Thank you for taking the time to see if the issues occurred for you as well.<br>
<br>
By the way you mentioned you tried running nProtect in Sandbox mode? Does Sandboxie support sandboxing drivers again?</div>

<br>
Glad to hear that it is more or less working now... What happens when you try to apply the settings that you want? <br>
<br>
As for the nprotect, following your steps to add the launch option to ninedragons, I was able to start it Sandboxed (the game never launched(not even outside sbie), I got errors and whatnot, but it did show a small "nProtect" window).<br>

nProtect GameGuard is a driver so I was asking if it was possible to even run it inside of Sandboxie? I just receive the error below.

<br>
The first screenshot shows the Direct Access paths that are already granted to ChromePrograms (they are the default paths to allow Chrome access to the phishing Database). In order to add something else, you must select the Program (for example &lt;ChromePrograms&gt;, then click "Add" and add the path you want the program to have direct access to. <br>
After that, you will be able to hit "Apply".<br>
As for the second screenshot, there is nothing added by default to "chrome.exe" itself, so you you will have to click "Add", and select the path (s) you want it to have Full Access to.<br>
For more info, check out this entry:<br>
<a href="../indexbccb.html?ResourceAccessSettings#file" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?Res ... tings#file</a><br>
<br>
Regarding nProtect, I did not install a driver in the Sandbox, I just attempted (without much success) to run ninedragons.exe with the launch option, and it displayed the nProtect box inside the Sandbox.<br>

Just though I would chip in.<br>

I started yesterday with exactly the same problem as described this thread.<br>
<br>
I use Windows 10 64bit Creators Update Sandboxie 5.18 Latest Chrome stable version. Wednesday night I started getting multiple error messages:<br>

It was impossible to start Chrome. Still not found the problem. Running now unsandboxed.<br>

<br>
Make sure to fully update Chrome outside Sandboxie, relaunch it to ensure changes went thru, then, clear your Sandbox contents and re-try launching Chrome Sandboxed. <br>
If the issue persists, please try reinstalling Chrome per previous comments. <br>
<br>
Do you have any Antivirus installed, or Addons in Chrome? <br>
------------------------------------------ X ------------------------------------------<br>
<strong>nehebkau,</strong><br>
<br>
Your issue looks just like this one  <a href="viewtopicc3a0c3a0.php?f=11&amp;t=23697&amp;hilit=aliexpress" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... aliexpress</a><br>
<br>
I still cannot reproduce it. I just updated  Chrome and created a new account on that site (using Google). No errors displayed.  <br>
If you have further information on how to reproduce the issue, please let us know.<br>
<br>
Are you using any antivirus/addons? <br>
<br>

				<div class="content">For a few weeks now, I have the same problem too. It started after some time from Windows Creator's Update. Chrome's main window opens but I get pop ups in lower right corner of the screen mention all installed extensions inside crashed. I get popup from sandboxie:<br>

Also when exploring the sandbox I see that there are a lot of errors logged in the sandboxed version of C:\Windows\System32\CatRoot2\dberr.txt (that are not present in the real file).<br>
<br>
My Sandbox is forcing Chrome to run inside it. Using Drop Admin Rights settings, and also giving full resource access to chrome profile using Applications &gt; Web Browser &gt; Google Chrome (all settings checked).<br>
<br>
I also tried manually to add all of D:\Users\User\User\Local\Google to direct access but it didn't help. This issue is present in 5.18 and also 5.19.1<br>
Chrome is 64-bit, Windows 10 Creator's update 64-bit.<br>

				<div class="content">Sphinx, do you by chance use the BlockProcessAccess Addon aka SBIExtra.dll?<br>
<br>
This one stood out in your log
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Ipc      X  $:chrome.exe</code></pre></div>
If chrome is only running inside of sandboxie I don't see why it should be prevented from writing to a same-box instance of itself.<br>
<br>
For troubleshooting purposes only you could try adding an OpenIPCPath=chrome.exe,$:chrome.exe under Sandbox Settings &gt; Resource Access &gt; IPC Access &gt; Direct Access<br>
Add Program &gt; chrome.exe<br>
Add &gt; $:chrome.exe<br>
<br>
Just be aware that this <strong>will</strong> still allow a <span style="text-decoration: underline">sandboxed version of chrome to</span> <em>write to</em> an <span style="text-decoration: underline">unsandboxed chrome</span> or even across boxes if you run more than one instance at a time. For testing the crash this might be good but I would not suggest keeping it for actual everyday usage even if it does aid in stopping the crash.</div>

				<div class="content">No, I don't use any kind of addon with Sandboxie. Also, I added $:chrome.exe to allowed IPC access.<br>

				<div class="content">I just want to echo sphinx8911's sentiments, also getting the same errors and on Windows Creator's update. The funny thing is Chrome(Version 57) was working fine until today, and I have been on the Creator's update for about a week now. <br>
<br>
Nothing was touched within the Sandbox or its settings. Chrome does not have direct access to anything outside of the sandbox. Chrome's Google auto updater is also blocked from internet access. As mentioned above Chrome worked without issue with these settings until today on a fresh boot when these errors showed up.<br>
<br>
I did try updating it to the latest stable Chrome 58 outside the sandbox, wiped the sandbox contents, and relaunched, but same problem.</div>

				<div class="content">Agree there's problems with chrome. They started after update to Win 10 pro 64 bit creators.<br>
<br>
I'm a long time user of Sandboxie. One pc our of 5 had problems.<br>
<br>
The problem of chrome not loading sandboxed occurred. A reload of Chrome and a reboot fixed it, eventually. Lots of other things were tried before that.<br>
<br>
Next, the bookmarks of a user would not update for one user. This user was recreated, deleted, and recreated. If a 2nd user under the same user profile was created, that user acted normally. Chrome was installed, uninstalled, reinstalled. Default options were changed. No success.<br>
<br>
It's a sandboxie problem, barb. Nothing I can do will fix this.</div>

Sorry to hear that but thanks for testing.<br>
<br>
I tried reproducing the issue in a fresh Win10 CU x64 VM but so far I'm not seeing it.<br>
Chrome 58.0.3029.81 x64 (not installed inside SBIE)<br>
Sandboxie 5.19.1<br>
Using 'Run Sandboxed'.<br>
With so many ppl having the same issue there must be some trigger or commonality. Does it still happen if you manually select chrome in the context menu and use 'run sandboxed'? I can't test forced programs in that VM as SBIE isn't registered so I'd like to at least rule that out.</div>
