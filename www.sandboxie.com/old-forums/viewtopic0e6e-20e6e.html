				<div class="content">Yes. Full time to try and recreate problems users may have that they may have OR for which forum cannot answer. I'll work directly with Curt and his team. I also will be working on documentation and getting the website updated (i.e SBIE errors, etc.)</div>

Boom! You are 100% correct. I've had the same thoughts. Moreoever, from a support standpoint, you folks are by far, the experts. I'll monitor and watch everyone help one another. For the most part, that does work. But there are times where something just "ain't workin'." So, that's where I'll attempt to gather info, recreate it as best I can and work with Curt and his team. And Feedback from everyone here... <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

I have been respectful but I just received a warning for this message:<br>

Professional and respectful. Not assuming something isn't being done or not meeting <em><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>your</strong></span></em> expectations. We have a process how things / issues are to be handled. Those processes are being followed. The forum is to assist with fellow users using SBIE and for me to jump and recreate / gather info when that fails. Debugging will be something the Devs will look at with the information I can provide to them. This saves them time allows them to actually "debug" as you........demanded I believe. <br>
<br>
I really wish you would concentrate on helping fellow SBIE users like you have so well in the past, Focus that energy on that and you will have nothing to worry about. The forum will stay focused on doing just that. Helping users.</div>

				<div class="content">I imagine you got a warning because Craigs been in the job all of about 2 weeks now supporting a new piece of software with a new team and you're already starting to criticize, seemingly to push the support agenda again. Please give the guy a break and let him settle in. It's just disrespectful and makes you look arrogant.<br>
<br>
You like to quote others and call them for not sticking to their word.. <br>

Well, it changes the environment around IE. It changes what IE "sees" per se. So ya, there is a lot going on there to fool IE.</div>
