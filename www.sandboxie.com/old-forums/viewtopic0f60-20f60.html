				<h3>Review Of Version 4.06</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Thu Oct 17, 2013 8:08 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I just installed the new 4.06 almost a day ago and have so-far tried it out a bit. So-far, it seems that it is much better than anything between the 4.02 and 4.05 Beta. Between these versions, I found numerous REPEAT processes from Sandboxie in the task manager, I mean SEVERAL, not just one of each from a single process. However, SO-FAR, this has not been the case with the 4.06, and I think as a result, (unlike those versions mentioned above), I have not experienced performance problems such as slowdowns and freeze-ups. However, this review doesn't yet carry much weight since I have only tested this version for a very short time. After I test it much longer, then my review on this version will have more weight. In any case, I am very grateful to TZuk for all of his efforts on this overall excellent program. No doubt it has been a great help to many of us!<br>
