				<h3>[.12] Rappelz does not run under Sandboxie v4.01.11</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi Tzuk,<br>
<br>
I have tried all I can to get <strong>Rappelz</strong> running under a V4.01.xx Sandboxie and have had no success to date.<br>
The following error is consistently returned: "<strong>SBIE2314 Canceling process GameMon.des</strong>".<br>
This is different from my previous posting at <a href="../phpbb/viewtopic1513.php?p=79458#79458" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/phpbb/viewtopi ... 9458#79458</a> (That problem is now solved with version 3.76).<br>
<br>
Rappelz and other games which run the "GameGuard" protection (GG) software has of late begun to spiral out of control.<br>
The developers of GG have as of May, changed GG so that it interferes with anything run inside a sandbox.<br>
<br>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">What this means:</span></strong><br>
* <strong>Sandboxed browsers will not run</strong> while GameGuard is present in memory as GG interfers with sandboxes now.<br>
* <strong>Only way to run Sandboxie while GG is active is to sandbox the game itself</strong> (ironic).<br>
<br>
Relevant Information about the PC that was used for testing:<br>
* Affected Software: <strong>Rappelz</strong>, downloadable from <a href="http://file.gpotato.eu/rappelz/installer/20121112_epic8.1/Rappelz_US_8.1.exe" class="postlink">http://file.gpotato.eu/rappelz/installe ... US_8.1.exe</a><br>
* Windows 7 Professional x64<br>
* Antivirus installed: Avira Antivir v10.2.0.719<br>
* Firewall: Comodo Firewall v3.14.130099.587<br>
<br>
In hopes that this problem will be addressed in Version 4.01 of Sandboxie, I have provided resource access logs from two different versions of sandboxie for attempting to run Rappelz under a sandbox.<br>
<br>
Rappelz under Sandboxie v3.76 (works):<br>

				<h3>Hi- Regarding the latest rappelz update</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Thu Jun 13, 2013 12:53 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>rappelzGeek</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Since the latest update of gameguard with the following updates mentioned below itseems like sandbox is failing at virtualizing the .dll files.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://en.rappelz.gpotato.com/News/All/4000000000/2623" class="postlink">http://en.rappelz.gpotato.com/News/All/4000000000/2623</a><br>
<br>
GameGuard update was regarding the following:<br>
 <br>
Periodic GameGuard update to the latest version.<br>
-Improved compatibility with Windows 8 OS and Anti-virus programs.<br>
-Enhanced stability.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://en.rappelz.gpotato.com/News/All/4000000000/2623" class="postlink">http://en.rappelz.gpotato.com/News/All/4000000000/2623</a><br>
<br>
<br>
This was the error given to me:<br>
<br>
SBIE2303 Could not hook VerifyCatalogFile (33, 5)<br>
SBIE2318 DLL initialization failed for 'setupapi.dll'<br>
<br>
I have provided sandbox with all the low level and high level permits for the box i use.</div>

				<div class="content">Reason code 5 in message SBIE2303 means access denied, this is because GameGuard is<br>
blocking modifications to program code and prevents Sandboxie from applying its hook.<br>

I don't want to "fix" that in Sandboxie, because that would mean trying to actively subvert GameGuard,<br>

I suggest you contact the makers of Rappelz and ask them to reconsider this change to GameGuard.</div>

It is such a shame that GameGuard decided to actively block sandboxie; I understand and respect your stance on not starting an arms race with the developers of GameGuard.<br>
<br>
On a different but related note: Is there any way to stop GameGuard from actively terminating all sandboxie'd windows upon it's launch? I sandboxie all my browsers, so once I launch anything with GameGuard I loose all ability to browse the internet = _ =;<br>
<br>
My current solution is to run my browers inside a virtual-machine (or vice versa), which is rather extreme just so i can see the latest forum posts for Rappelz (ironic). To make matters worse, GameGuard is in essence, a "legalized" rootkit/malware that actively hooks into other processes and causes damage, using methods derived from malware (programs crash, my firewall crashes upon gameguard's exit etc).<br>
<br>
If you can provide a solution, or a suggestion (other than stop playing Rappelz <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil">  ) I and a lot of other sandboxie users (that use it for web-browsers) would really appreciate it. Thanks! ^^<br>
<br>
Unfortunately contacting the makers of GameGuard will prove fruitless (tho I may take your advice anyhow): they pointfingers at everyone but themselves all the time when it comes to compatibility issues or performance issues.<br>
As it stands, I have a list of software (including video codecs) that gets terminated or crashes due to GameGuard  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

my advice is - do stop playing this game. it's the only effective way that we, customers, may utter our opinion and make a company rethink their stand. cheers!</div>
