				<div class="content">If the computer loses power the contents may be corrupted like any normal files or folders, it all depends what the drive was doing at the moment. The contents will not vanish otherwise though as the deletion command, if set, (eg standard RMDIR) is started by sbiectrl when it detects the box is no longer in use. So if that didn't happen before the power loss then the command was not issued. You can however manually delete the box before you run it after you power back on to be sure it's clean.<br>
<br>
If on the other hand you mean a program shutdown or rebooted your pc with a box opened it may not be handled differently but I can't say for sure what would become of the contents. I'd guess that would be a case specific thing as to which programs were stopped first and other things such as tweaks that might alter the timeout to kill apps and possibly other stuff as well. Maybe someone here knows a bit more about how that would be handled though.<br>
<br>
If you *want* the contents to vanish in a power loss case you could set up a non-persistent RAMDisk (eg no hdd copy/file) and direct the specific Sandbox to use a path on that new 'drive'. In that case the contents would be stored in the RAM and be gone when power is lost.</div>

All contents remain inside the sandbox, nothing gets out. You can delete contents after rebooting. And if you had any downloads inside the sandbox, you can recover them if you wish.<br>
