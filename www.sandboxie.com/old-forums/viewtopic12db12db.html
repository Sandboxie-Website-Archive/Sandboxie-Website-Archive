<br>
Is it possible to implement an "Open Sandbox" menu item that can store a sandbox outside the Sandbox Top-Level Folder? This would make it easier to make some sandboxed applications portable and still use local sandboxes.<br>
<br>
I'm just new to Sandboxie and haven't tried it thouroughly but it looks very promising. Two points I further want to address is that certain links don't work on your website (if you want I can list them for you) and It would be great to have the design of this website build into the Sandboxie application (only if one wants to, the die-hards can have the minimalistic GUI) like a nice looking Start Menu with same look and feel as the Start menu of WinXP and the Sandboxie control with the program icons.<br>
<br>
What are the special features that registered users get actually?<br>
<br>
Greets and thanks for the program,<br>

I don't really understand what you mean or what  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">  Maybe <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/Junction.html" class="postlink">Junction</a> can help with that?<br>
<br>
With Junction, you can map C:\MyPortable to (for example) "C:\MySandboxes\Sandbox\MyBox\Device\HarddiskVolume1\Program Files".<br>
<br>
Is this what you're looking for?<br>
<br>
But remember, don't tell Sandboxie to work on the junction point at C:\MyPortable.  Let Sandboxie work as if nothing has changed, and use the Junction from outside the sandbox.  That's the safest approach.<br>

Please do list them, and I will take care of it.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>and It would be great to have the design of this website build into the Sandboxie application </div></blockquote>

Say what?<br>

Please review the FAQ, heavily revised recently, and now answers this question.</div>
