				<h3>Hardlinks Workarounds</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I see there are only a few complaints about Hardlinks. And I'm assuming it is still not an easy fix as Curt@invincea had said about it in a post he made or that there may not be enough of a demand by users for it to be worked on, which is understandable. <br>
<br>
I'm currently using a Mod Manger for games and it requires Hardlinks which fail to be created while everything is running inside of a sandbox. So my quick question is, Does anyone have any thoughts or workarounds for this issue? Any input would be appreciated!<br>
<br>
Also if I seem to be misunderstanding something about the issue please let me know. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
Thanks</div>

				<div class="content">Hardlinks do not seem to be supported by Sandboxie. The application I would like to use creates Hardlinks, and I'm trying to see if it is at all possible to allow them to be created in a Sandbox by an application or if anyone has any workarounds for the issue.<br>
<br>
The post I was referring to in my original post by Curt@invincea:<br>

No, they never worked correctly.  Hardlinks were going right out of the sandbox.  And unfortunately, it is not a simple fix.  We will consider this for a future release.<br>
<br>
I am interested in knowing how many people are running into issues with hardlinks.  This is the 1st report we've had.

				<div class="content">Hey RooJ,<br>
<br>
Yeah I have actually tried NMM, Vortex Alpha and Mod Organizer all with the same issue, unfortunately from what I read it seems Fallout4 and Skyrim-SE require the use of Hardlinks.<br>
<br>
If you were working with the Skyrim-SE edition, you would not happen to know the version of NMM you were on do you?<br>
<br>
Thanks</div>

				<div class="content">Ahh sorry, I have the original version of skyrim, not SE. The version I have which doesn't use hardlinks is 0.56.1. Also doesn't have the .net framework requirements that the later version has.<br>
<br>
Good luck</div>
