				<div class="content">The current tree style folder navigation in use is... somewhat worse than what Windows offers natively. The interface for the recovery box and the "files and folders" view of the main windows has definitely improved and is much more functional but it still feels "hand" made and unnatural and sort of like a java based program where the interface was ported from another OS.<br>
<br>
At least for me, each upper level (subfolder) expands too much to the side and not just neetly indented below the parent. Since I use subfolders extensively to organize data, this means I have to scroll quite a bit sideways (and up/down) to recover the document I want. Would be great to have GUI more like what I imagine most people are used to when navigating folder structures in Windows. Or if the native controls are somehow unsuitable, then maybe to mimic their appearance closer.<br>
<br>
On a similar topic, when there are files in a sub-sub-subfolder, it would be nice, when clicking on the (+) of the grandparent, the tree automatically unfolds all the way to the child folder that actually has some files in it. <br>
<br>

Thanks for the great work. Sandboxie is working great for so many months now that I feel bad for not buying the lifetime license and only having an annual one.</div>
