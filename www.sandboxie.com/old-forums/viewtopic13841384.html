				<div class="content">Hello Mings and all,<br>
<br>
I have been testing disabling different AVG components and changing options, however I was not able to get it to work until I added the following to the Sandbox settings:<br>
<br>
Right Click on your Sandbox --&gt; Sandbox Settings<br>
Resource Access --&gt;File Access --&gt; Write-Only Access<br>
Hit Add and enter the following: <br>
C:\Program Files (x86)\AVG\Antivirus*<br>
<br>
After that, I was able to launch Firefox and Chrome in the Sandbox. (I have not tested other apps yet).<br>
Still looking into this, will update this thread with further info, whenever possible.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>

<br>
This is strange because I've been runnin a sandboxed Google Chrome + AVG + Windows 7 64 bit for years with no issues at all. The crashing started with the windows 10 update.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks again!</div>

				<div class="content">This has not helped me. I installed a well-known anti-virus program I cannot name due to your rules and things worked fine for some time. I uninstalled it today replacing it with another program I also cannot name (though I am posting in the correct topic) due to your rules.<br>
<br>
I gave a precise and concise description of my problem but was falsely told I was trying to advertise another program. Needless to say this has left me unable to describe my problem other than very vaguely, and a little unhappy. I was told to post here if it didn't solve my problem and it didn't.<br>
<br>
If you care to look at my original post you should find more detail.</div>

<br>
If you have AVG installed, the steps above should cover the issue. Be sure to test them in a new Sandbox with default settings (you can also try deleting the contents of your current one, to see if that helps).<br>
If you are using a different antivirus, please let us know which one, I believe your last post mentioned BitDefender, we have a specific fix for that one:<br>
<br>
Free version:<br>
<a href="viewtopic44be44be.html?f=11&amp;t=21539&amp;start=165#p128854" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=21539&amp;start=165#p128854</a><br>
If you have the paid version, the workaround is the same, except for:<br>
WriteFilePath=C:\Program Files\Bitdefender\*   (instead of WriteFilePath=C:\Program Files\Bitdefender Antivirus Free\*) <br>
<br>
If you are still experiencing problems, be sure to have fully uninstalled your previous antivirus software (many provide a removal tool, as there might be leftovers), then reboot and test the steps in a new sandbox with default settings.<br>
<br>
Please provide this information should the problem persist:<br>

Hi Barb! This solved compatibility problems perfectly between Sandboxie and Bitdefender Free.<br>
<br>
Would this setting mean all sandboxed applications can write to the real Bitdefender Free folder (meaning, write outside sandbox). I assume any sandboxed application writing malicious files to such a folder would still be sandboxed and prevented from doing real damage to the system, unless I tried to actually execute the dropped file outside the sandbox?</div>

<br>
Please see below for information regarding how WriteFilePath works (which is what we used for the workaround):<br>
<a href="../index2441.html?WriteFilePath" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?WriteFilePath</a><br>
<br>
Also, please have a look at the updated workaround provided by Syrinx:<br>
