				<div class="content">hi! <br>
actually, i'm an old user of sandboxie but when I tried to run the new version, the application that I ran as sandboxed is a teeny weeny box in the upper left of my screen. I just can't seem to find a way to maximize or edit the size of the window.<br>
Hence, I cannot do anything with the application since I cannot see the menu. <br>
<br>
Hope anyone can help. I browsed youtube tutorials, forums regarding conflicts, issues but to no avail <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad">. I'm not sure if I just missed out the info regarding resizing.<br>
<br>
PS. I'm running steam app for this. Win 10 64-bit user. I have also excluded SANDBOX folder in my BitDefender.</div>

				<div class="content">Could be something related to a recent update in Steam. We'll have to look. Steam is not something we routinely test. <br>
<br>
Does it occur in any other Window?</div>

				<div class="content">hi. I haven't tried it though. can I open any software or app like Microsoft word just to test the dual client?<br>
I'm thinking either our game or the sandboxie for win10 does have conflict with steam, or the 64-bit version of the sandboxie with win10...i'm not really sure though, my sister was able to do dual client in win7 using the the 5.10 (32-bit version)</div>

				<div class="content">hi, btw, the game i'm trying to run is only 32-bit. do you think that is the reason why it appears like this? the game is running in the sandboxie though, but the window is too small (as shown in the pic)</div>

Doubtful. It be Windows 10 (we've seen similar w/ FF) and/or Steam.<br>
<br>
It's unknown at this time.</div>
