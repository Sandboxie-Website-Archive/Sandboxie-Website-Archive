				<h3>Sandboxie, positive reviews ? Asking the infinitive.</h3>

				<div class="content">To write positive reviews about Sandboxie, is a task that is impossible. How can one write an infinite treatise ?<br>
<br>
But what I can do, is ask alan@invincea not to hide behind a "no reply" curtain and let members contest the posts he makes. It does seem a rather one-way autocratic ticket to "This is what I think" but "I am not interested what you do".<br>
<br>
Perhaps alan@invincea would devote a proportion of his undoubtful wisdom by posting in his "Announcements" what exactly Invincea intend to do with Sandboxie now that Ronan Tzuk has passed his "Sell-by-date" and taken his extraordinary genius on retirement walk-abouts ?<br>
<br>
Will there still be a FREE version of Sandboxie ? Will Invincea honor existing license holders, including the "life-time" members ?<br>
<br>
Will Invincea continue the exceptional stability of Sandboxie ?<br>
<br>
In fact, what the hell will Invincea do ? Can one improve the unimprovable ? Well, I suppose one can try, but it sounds like a "chase your own tail" job to me. This only leaves Markets and Money and we are all accustomed as to what that entails.<br>
<br>
There you are Alan, take a break from writing your autocratic, protected Announcements and let us have some real comments from you on what miraculous improvements Invincea intend for our beloved and highly respected Sandboxie. Go on Alan, give it a whirl - inspire us with insurmountable joy.</div>

				<div class="content">To see what Invincea is doing right now, take a look at the 4.09 beta forum <a href="viewforum590b590b.html?f=46" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=46</a><br>

And yes, there will continue to be a free version.</div>

				<div class="content">Or you could just make a thread / PM Alan if you have any issues because there just might be the possibility he wants to keep the 'Announcements' section of the board neat and clean, like most all admins of forums do...</div>

I was not suggesting that Alan open the Announcement board to all and sundry. By all means, let him keep his exclusive "no reply" choice, but as he wears the hat of our new owner - Invincea - then come clean and answer a few very basic questions concerning the anxieties of all users, a few of which I posed in my OP.  An open Forum is the place for that, not PM`s.<br>
<br>
Of course, any other member of the Invincea team could answer these questions, where members are given the opporyunity to respond.<br>
<br>
Curt@invincea has in fact satisfactorily answered my questions by PM, but that becomes personal information and is not openly posted for all members to read.</div>

				<div class="content">Sandboxie continues to prove to me that no anti-virus program should be trusted.   SBIE has and still is the main protection system for my XP VM (and hence my Win7 OS Host).   The only thing lacking in SBIE is a key stroke scanner detection but that has always been out of the scope for SBIE and you can get another program to detect this form of attack.   Now that XP is no longer maintained my Microsoft, SBIE will be even more depended upon and do hope SBIE continues to support XP for as long as XP continues to be viable.   Thanks to Tzuk, he picked the right company to insure that would be the case and I'm very grateful to Invincea for it's continued support of SBIE.   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>
