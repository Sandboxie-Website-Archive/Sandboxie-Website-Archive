				<div class="content">I've made no effort to hide the fact I don't like the Sandboxie icon in the past. This isn't so much about that as I also hate having more running than I need. (yes yes my list of security apps doesn't support that statement) Currently I have the sbiectrl set to <strong>not</strong> launch at boot but I <em>have</em> checked that sbiectrl should be started 'When a program starts in the sandbox.' as some of my boxes do make use of the auto-delete function that is currently being discussed and this is (currently) controlled by the sbiecrtl. I also <strong>do</strong> like being able to see the active sandboxed icon in the tray for peace of mind.<br>
<br>
What I'd like to see as an option along with 'When a program starts in the sandbox.' is a linked option to close sbiectrl once there are no longer any active sandboxes. Eg have it pop up when active and disappear when not in use.<br>
<br>
This <span style="text-decoration: underline">isn't</span> anything important and I can't imagine there will be a high demand for such a feature but after my last comment on the deletion thread I figured it <em>might</em> be something worth 'mentioning' at the very least.</div>

				<div class="content">I would like to make a comment on this. I use Sandboxie with my browsers, it is set to run not on start up but for when I open a browser - it is also set to delete the sandbox when I come out of the browser - both work very well. Is it possible for Sandboxie to close after it has deleted the sandbox and there is no current activity?</div>
