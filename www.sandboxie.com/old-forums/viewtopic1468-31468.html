				<div class="content">Using Sandboxie and reading some post on forum it seems some programs can not run under Sandboxie and in some case it s the wanted behaviour.<br>
In my opinion you should allow to run every program in sandbox mode.<br>
I was thinkning to create this feature for having a "shared cloud pc":<br>
I can create a virtual machine and cloning it, installing at my home pc and one in my office pc. Using a cloud service like dropbox i can share the most directories to have all always synchronized, excluding  system directories like c:\Windows to save cloud space and it would be a big effort to upload and download all "system files".<br>
<br>
If I decided to install some software, probably it will install some file in the "system folder and it will add some keys to registry. Sandboxie could help in this...<br>
all modifies will be done in a sandoboxied folder shared with the cloud service, so that also on the other pc the new installed program will work without problems.<br>
 <br>
Does it sound interesting?<br>
Thanks</div>

If my .exe needs a windows system dll ( so it is in a c:\windows\system32 for example) it will not work?<br>

Hi evs, in a sandbox with default settings, sandboxed programs have access to c:\windows\system32. Your sandboxed exe can read files there. But can not modify this files. And any changes it makes to c:\windows\system32 get written to the sandbox. <br>
