				<h3>[.01] SBIE 4 - Failed to start program error 267</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello, <br>
I upgraded from version 3.57 and now I get this error message when trying to double click a file on a sbie forced folder on a shared mapped drive, <br>
<br>
Forced folder is set to (this is a mapped network drive)<br>
Z:\test\<br>
<br>
Forced Program is (I don't this this contributes to the problem, since even programs not listed here get the error.)<br>
mpc-hc.exe<br>
<br>
when I try to double click on an avi file under z:\test it pops up this error <br>
<br>
SBIE2337 Failed to start program:  [44 / 267]<br>
<br>
this seems to only happen on shared folders from what I can tell.<br>
<br>
if I use right click &gt; Open With - then choose media player classic it will open ok, so its something with double clicking the file, btw I just used mpc as an example it seems to have the issue with any type of file including winrar, opening zip files, even txt files with notepad will get the error.<br>
<br>
Ideas?</div>

				<div class="content">Upon further testing it appears using "Open With" doesn't cause the program to open in sandboxie at all even if the current dir is under a "forced folder", though it will run under sandboxie if the open with program was under "forced programs", not listed it will start outside of sandboxie.<br>
<br>
I also updated to the latest version of sbie 4.05.12 and the "SBIE2337 Failed to start program: [44 / 267]" is still present<br>
<br>
Basically<br>
1. Double click produces SBIE2337 Failed to start program: [44 / 267] under a mapped network drive, looking under task manager the program does start then quickly close<br>
2. Using explorer Right click -&gt; "Open With" - (program) under a "forced folder" path fails to open the program in sandboxie</div>
