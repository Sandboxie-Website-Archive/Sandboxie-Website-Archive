				<div class="content">Overdrive Media Console is an inter-library media source that supplies AV e-books and audiobooks.  It uses WMP DRM for .wma files.  WinXP can download and authenticate .wma autobook files successfully with WMP9.  Win7-Pro fails.  Authentication key is blocked for unknown reasons.  SBoxie error message offers to capture the file in the clipboard, but I can't find a way to recover it.  v4.04</div>

				<div class="content">I totally blew that interactive error analysis.  I should have looked-up the error code and/or published the entire exchange.  I was in a hurry and just wiped the CONSOLE and went back to XP. Becauase I use automated start-up and scheduled automatic applications, I have disabled Win7 UAC login and exe pop-ups.  But something was still blocking the .wma license key from writing to the OVERDRIVE MEDIA CONSOLE. Thanks, I'll work on that again later.  Bet me that the support at ODMC is going to blow me off stating "you can't run in a isolation sandbox", not realizing I have done it in XP for years.</div>
