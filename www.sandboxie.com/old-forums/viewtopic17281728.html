				<div class="content">The one from the Chrome Webstore, but it says binary component true (NaCl) and it runs through nacl64.exe. It's 3.0.14. I've also learned that there is another Chrome extenstion on the LastPass Website (3.0.15). On the website the version without the binary component actually installs with the binary component and the one with the binary component installs without it.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>
<br>
I've tried the other version (3.0.15) outside of Sandboxie. There is no nacl64.exe involved, but this one doesn't even connect to LastPass outside of Sandboxie.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

As for the rest, maybe you should rather ask the LastPass guys to sort out their plugin mess. Beyond the stuff you mentioned, there's also the "universal installer" which installs yet another different version AFAIK.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Der Moloch wrote:</cite>I think I have run into a new problem regarding the latest Last Pass version in chrome. The plugin now seems to be run through nacl64.exe. I verified this by deactivating the Last Pass extension. nacl64.exe only starts together with Chrome, if the Last Pass extension is active. The new problem is running Chrome in Sandboxie seems to break Last Pass somehow, because the extension no longer connects to the Last Pass Account.<br>

I am having the same problem with Lastpass-plugin 3.0.16 + Chrome 31.0.1650.57 m under Windows 7 SP1 x64, LastPass simply no  works at all, it can't even provide any username/password fill up operation. Even if LastPass cannot access LastPass account over the Internet, it should able to access the local stored LastPass password data but in this case LastPass simply failed to function.  Sandboxie also did not pop up any warning of any program attempt access to the Internet.</div>
