				<div class="content">Someone on the Online Armour forum helped me by giving the link to the thread here dealing with the trouble those new Windows updates caused for Sandboxie. I responded with a "Thank you. I am sure Tzuk will find a solution to it soon, if he hasn't already."<br>
<br>
And now I see I was not exaggerating. I just clicked on that link Tzuk gave for a new updated version, and it looks fine on my machine, all my original settings intact.<br>
<br>
Until just a few moments ago I kept the problem a bay by doing a system restore and refusing Windows to download/install new updates without my permission.<br>
But now I can click on that little yellow shield on my task bar and let it do its thing without being nasty to Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
Thank you for the fast help, Tzuk!<br>
<br>
PS:<br>
This was funny: I let Windows download/install those updates, let it reboot, and then when I hit my Opera browser, a Sandboxie error message appeared again. I thought "Oh, oh, there we go again. Back to Tzuk's forum. Let me try Outlook Express first though." That worked fine. I hit Opera again just to double check: no problem this time. Then Firefox. Perfect. Last IE6, also as good as always.<br>
<br>
So I say it again: Thank you Tzuk!</div>
