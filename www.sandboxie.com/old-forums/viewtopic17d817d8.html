Change log doesn't state the font issue was addressed in this release, and it wasn't. It will be in .11 to come shortly. This release mainly had to do with sound issues in media players.</div></blockquote>

Thats strange. When I checked the change log earlier it listed the font issue as being fixed but now that entry is no longer there!</div>

@xy667,<br>
<br>
You were correct, changelog item 2) below has been removed after you alerted this font issue which had not been fixed yet. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> <br>
<br>
Fixes in 5.01.10<br>
1) Windows 10-10525 now works.<br>
<em>.....2) Windows 10 Font issue has been fixed....removed</em><br>
3) Sound problem with MPC-HC, Potplayer, et. al. is fixed. MPC-HC still puts up an initialization error dialog when starting. Just ignore this for now. The player works fine after that.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks..lol this morning I was seeing folks report (fonts still not working...Skype errors..etc.) and I said....hmmm. The font issue was addressed, but not to be in this .10 release when I left yesterday. <br>
This .10 was only to address sound in Media Players and the fast ring release of Win 10.<br>
<br>
The final font issue binaries were finalzied late last night (which fixes IMVU among things) and was to be placed in the .10 for everyone to grab (thus the change log verbiage noting this.). But the version that is live isn't the merged version. So you only get the sound fixes. We're working on getting that up there....but I haven't been granted those magical powers yet!  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"><br>

				<div class="content">I have been having a problem with Sandboxie 5.01.10 and the multiprotocol chat client Miranda NG.  Previous beta builds had their issues, in particular weird font issues that have been corrected in this build. However, I am experiencing random crashes now. There is no warning, or no error message. The application just terminates. To my knowledge there is nothing specific that triggers this.  I am on a Windows 10 64 bit operating system, if that makes a difference. My configurations for sandboxie and Miranda NG been the same now as they always have been, so that been no changes there.  Has anyone else experienced this issue?<br>

Installed 5.01.10 and confirmed that MPC-HC player now has audio but not after having to get rid of this error message each time I play my videos :<br>

Thanks, Curt, this is correct. The initialization error doalog box comes from MPC-HC media player and upon clicking "No", the video will play fine.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>
