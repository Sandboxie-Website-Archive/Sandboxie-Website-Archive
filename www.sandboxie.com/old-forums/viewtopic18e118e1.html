<br>
<strong>Fixes in 4.17.8</strong><br>
<br>
1) Fixed rare BSOD reported by APMichael that could occur when resuming from sleep.<br>
<br>
<strong>Fixes in 4.17.7</strong><br>
<br>
1) The print spooler is now allowed to write files outside the sandbox according to OpenFilePath settings.  So for example, with BullZip PDF Printer, you can open the folders it uses to store its work files.<br>
<br>
<strong>Fixes in 4.17.6</strong><br>
<br>
1) The print spooler is now allowed to write temporary files into its own spooler work folder outside the sandbox.  This should eliminate the SBIE1319 msgs when not printing to file.<br>
<br>
<strong>Fixes in 4.17.5</strong><br>
<br>
1) More print spooler block improvements.  Now, when you get the error "SBIE1319 Blocked spooler print to file", you can double-click the error message to open the print spooler for that particular process.<br>
2) I removed the spooler print to file property sheet in the sandbox settings.  This is too risky to allow setting it permanently in the GUI where it can easily be forgotten.  You can still add AllowSpoolerPrintToFile=y manually in sandbox.ini.<br>
3) Error msgs when auto-deleting a sandbox will now be shown to the user.<br>
<br>
<strong>Fixes in 4.17.4</strong><br>
<br>
1) The print spooler block has been improved.  Any time a sandboxed process uses the print spooler to write to a file, it will be blocked and you will get error "SBIE1319  Blocked spooler print to file". <br>
Even when not printing to file, sometimes the print spooler will attempt to write temporary files and be blocked by Sandboxie.  The print still prints successfully.  If these error popups become annoying, just hide SBIE1319.<br>
You can allow the print spooler to write outside the sandbox under Sandbox Settings-&gt;Restrictions-&gt;Print Spooler.  See that property sheet for more information.<br>
<br>
<strong>Fixes in 4.17.3</strong><br>
<br>
1) Fixed Chrome SBIE2205 Service not implemented:  Win32Init.5 (00000005)<br>
2) Changed hook for ChangeDisplaySettingsEx() to fix game using undocumented flag.<br>
3) Added new sandbox.ini setting: AllowPrintToFile.  The default is AllowPrintToFile=n.<br>
   Print to file via the print spooler is a security hole which behaves very differently in Win 7 vs. Win 8.  In Win 7, we can allow most print to file.  In Win 8, due to MS printer driver changes, we have to block most print to file requests.  So Win 7 users most likely will not have to add this setting in sandbox.ini.  For Win 8 users, if you want to be able to print to file, you need to add AllowPrintToFile=y.  I suggest you only do this temporarily because it does open a security hole.  When Sandboxie blocks a print to file, you will get error "SBIE1319 Blocked request to print to file".<br>
<br>
<strong>Fixes in 4.17.2</strong><br>
<br>
1) Added Hitman Pro Alert to templates.ini<br>
2) Changed hook for ChangeDisplaySettingsEx() to allow CDS_RESET. A user reported that a game (fifa15) is trying to use this and failing resulting in incorrect display colors.<br>
3) DFS mapped drives are now supported (<a href="viewtopic6d086d08.php?f=11&amp;t=18825&amp;p=100656" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 5&amp;p=100656</a>)<br>
4) VMWare HGFS (Host Guest File System) mapped drives are now supported.<br>
5) A BSOD bugcheck reported by a user when using bittorrent has been removed (this was a rare situation).  SbieDrv was detecting corrupted memory when no corruption had occurred.<br>
6) Fixed a rare bug in clipboard handling that could crash SbieSvc.<br>
7) WebEx running under Chrome would sometimes hang.<br>
<br>
<strong>Fixes in 4.17.1</strong><br>
<br>
1) Recent Windows update in Win 8-64 causes Skype (and possibly other apps) to issue error SBIE2335 Initialization failed for process Skype.exe [33 / 0]</div>

There are a couple of threads about this.  It's not luck, developers have stated that no at this time SBIE isn't compatible.  They won't do much until Win 10 is much closer to release.<br>

The public beta will be along soon, and surely the full release will follow sooner than later. If MSoft is ready to allow a wider beta release as it sees a BENEFIT, Invincea should consider the same (as a beta, or even an alpha). <br>
<br>
Losing Sandboxie is preventing me using Win 10 on a serious basis!</div>

When the gamelauncher sits active in the background, at some point it will also crash with these errors. It then disrupts online gameplay since the Sandbox messagebox brings up the desktop.</div>

Hi Dun. a few weeks ago a friend in another forum was asking about Opera 12.17 and Sandboxie. At the time, I was using SBIE 4.15.10, something like that. The new and old version of Opera, both ran fine for me. I don't remember if it was in W7 or XP when I tested but all went well.<br>
<br>
I am not having issues between Flash and Sandboxie. In fact, I think things are better now than they were a few months ago. At least, that's my feeling. But sometimes, in some systems things work better between SBIE and Flash if you disable Flash PM in W7 and up or disable plugin container in XP. I used to disable plugin container in XP but for the past few months, I enabled plugin container back in that computer.<br>
<br>
I have very little use for Flash in W7 so I don't keep the program installed in that PC. When I need it, I install it sandboxed and have things setup in that PC for PM to be disabled. But the last few time that I tested Flash in W7 with PM on, I haven't experienced an issue.<br>
<br>
When I tried Firefox 37 a few months ago, it was a very very early version and for the most part, the browser ran fine in SBIE. I did notice a few things that were not working right but they had nothing to do with SBIE. No crash in SBIE.<br>
