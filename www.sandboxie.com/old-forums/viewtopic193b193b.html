				<div class="content">This is a really great piece of software. I just downloaded 2.25, and expect no problems since I had none with the previous version.<br>
<br>
Though I've tried to get a lot of people to try or use this thing, I am coming up against unexpected resistance. I'm not at all sure why, but possibly I'm just not explaining how the thing works well enough.<br>
<br>
So far, I have also had 100% success running other applications and browsers that I have tried running "in a sandbox". It performs all the required functions in such a simple way -- many people I know are downloading and using the VMware browser appliance (at 200 megs) to accomplish the same ends.<br>
<br>
I hope it stays free, of course, but if we can convince enough people to use this thing that it becomes commercially viable, a little money is certainly deserved. Keep up the good work.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks.  I guess the idea takes a little bit getting used to.  It may be easier to explain "a whole separate computer", even if virtual, than the concept of a sandbox.  VMware is certainly less abstract, with its single separate window for the entire guest machine.</div>
