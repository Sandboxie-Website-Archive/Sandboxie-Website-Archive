				<div class="content">It would be nice to have an option to run an application outside of its sandbox, by simply right-clicking the object (shortcut/process/file/folder) and choosing "Run unsandboxed", rather then picking "Run sandboxed", and the choose not to run it sandboxed, and to have to press CTRL+Shift when clicking "Run sandboxed".<br>

				<div class="content">I don't know about that, my feeling is that putting two things on the context menu is too much.  But I suppose I can this as an option that is turned off by default.</div>

It would be a nice approach. This way every use would work with what he/she feels most comfortable with. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

Have I missed something? I have internet explorer and firefox in my forced programs list. If I want to run one of them unsandboxed I have to remove them from the forced programs list, save the settings and run the program, then add them back to the forced programs list. Is there an easier way to do this? If not, then your feature request certainly gets my vote.<br>

Or are you talking about something entirely different.<br>

This item is set to disable programs from starting forced, for only 10 seconds when you use it.<br>
<br>
You can set this to a longer time period by using the menu File &gt; Disable Forced Programs, and set the time to something longer.<br>
The new setting will be remembered from then on.<br>
If you have the disable in effect for some period of time, and you want to cancel it, just right-click the tray icon and you will see that the "Disable..." item is checked.<br>
Just left-click to cancel the Disable operation and put forcing back in effect.</div>
