<br>
Will it continue to exist independently and further developed?<br>
<br>
Will there be new versions of sandboxie released?<br>
<br>
What will become of our lifetime licenses?</span><br>

For what you paid for Sandboxie just what do you think Tzuk owes you, his life.   I suspect he will show more loyalty, then you are.</div>

				<div class="content">Pete, I think some of these folks only think that Tzuk owes them a lifetime of indentured servitude as opposed to being enslaved outright.    <br>
<br>
Simply amazing to consider what some folks think their small investment in a piece of software buys them.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

<br>
Thank you for everything that you have done. It's been great finding out about this gem and using it. Probably one of my most frequently used security tool and you can definitely feel the amount of time and effor put into it (except for the UI <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing">). Anyway thanks and I hope the future for you is bright!</div>

				<div class="content">Wary not, my little friends, for <strong>Ronen</strong> did not promise us, nor gave any personal loyalty nor anything, so swear not in vain. Yet, for what it's worth, it's ok with my till he's onboard too, say, as a lead programmer. Perhaps, later he can become a 'lazy boss' and leave coding and thinking out, which would greatly damage SBIE or whatever name it might have then.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I would like to kindly inquire, well, I'm just curious...<br>
<strong>Ronen</strong>, what is/was the main reason (if any) to, let's say, unite with a corporation:<br>
a) money<br>
b) time<br>
c) popularity/self-affirmation<br>
d) possible benefits from collective work<br>
e) some other better conceptions?<br>
<br>

The only jackass around here is you...one abusive comment after the next. Either you are Ronen or your head is so far up his ass as to make you indistinguishable.</div>
