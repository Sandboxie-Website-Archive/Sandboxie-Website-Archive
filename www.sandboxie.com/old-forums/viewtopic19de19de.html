				<h3>Making Windows 8 Look and Behave Like Windows 7</h3>

				<div class="content">Anyone using my new laptop with Windows 8 would think it was running on Windows 7.<br>
<br>
I used "Startisback" for changing the Windows 8 look to the Windows 7 look and functioning. On top of the Windows 7 Start menu the Windows 8 "Metro" screen appears as an icon, just in case you are so foolish as to want to ever even see it again. (It really is only good for tablets. Even having a touchscreen on a note book makes no sense. All the time holing up a Nazi like stretched out arm to tap and swipe your screen while the touchpad is even closer to you than the key board, let alone the screen.)<br>
<br>
That Windows 8 "Metro" screen would still appear blocking where I was from sight every time my finger swiped from the right to the left on my touchpad, but I got permanently rid of that by disabling "Edge Motion" under "mouse settings." <br>
<br>
If it would not have been for the possibility to make Windows 8 look and behave just like Windows 7 I would have tried to find a laptop with Windows 7 on it -looks like not sold anymore in my country- or bought the latter OS separately and installed it replacing Windows 8. The work would have been finding and getting all the right drivers for the laptop. I'm glad I didn't have to go through all that.<br>
<br>
There are many other "Change Windows 8 into Windows 7 -and even Windows xp-" programs, but after trying out a few I liked Startisback best. Here's a list:<br>

				<div class="content">Recently had to replace my dead PC so now have Win8.1 myself.   My Asus came with Classic Shell but it was not installed.   I did my best to get use to Metro, but finally I broke down and installed Classic Shell.  It's both free and fantastic.   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
