LOL I love the pic...Fine mate, I agree with those alternatives you mentioned above, then you go buy them, maybe Sandboxie is not for your budget, too expensive (being sarcastic). Oh btw Sandboxie it's the best at sanboxing, high quality have a price, oh btw the actual price it's a bargain, no doubts.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"></div>

finally, many protection software are cheaper then sandboxie, and if not, local store often have them on sale.</div></blockquote>
And none is as good as Sandboxie. Samcsli, seriously, in my personal opinion, none of those programs that you are thinking about are even worth as much as Sandboxies free version. If you gave me the choice of using Sandboxies free version or a combo of any three paid security programs out of the ones that you are comparing to SBIE, I ll take Sandboxies free version. Thats how much this program is worth, in my view.<br>
<br>
I honestly believe that. And I also believe that getting yourself a license is one of the best things that you can do with your money. I live in a very poor country, third world and things are pretty rough over here right now. But I am glad that I have a SBIE license. And purchasing it is the best money that I have ever spend on line. No doubt about it. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
Like I said in another post, I would like to see the lifetime license make a comeback but even if it does not, the price for the one year personal license is still worth every cent. Its pretty cheap, <br>

That reasoning is flawed because Sandboxie FREE will protect your computer just fine. And if you owned many many computers you could put the free version on each one of them - forever. To use that gift against the developer by claiming it's not fair to pay the same amount of money for something you already own mostly is what is not fair.</div></blockquote>
No, maybe you got me wrong or I didn't wrote clearly. I did not mean the gift as you owning. I mean the full version of SB after you paid for. After purchasing it there is no more work to be done to use it an infinite amount of time. If the devs did some updates I am fine to pay again for it. And these updates are only a small part of the whole software. So they should not cost the same amount of money again. There are no differences between short time and long timer user. There are no costs for the devs to keep on running a bought version (except updates for that I can pay for). I do not fully need the full-version but sometimes it would be good to have one. These moments could be once a year or 100 times or even not at all. To buy SB at these moments to use it once and never need it again in this year would be to expensive (15€ to use it ounce). Buying it every year at the same time is neither good if you don't need it in a year (pay 15€ without using it at all). If you pay for a longer time period for example 4 year or lifetime it would average out. (Might be different for power users.)
<blockquote><div><cite>JoeHood wrote:</cite>
And for those who claim to be one of the good old friends, how is it you existed for so long on just the free version? If now the lifetime license is so important?</div></blockquote>
As I wrote in my first post I couldn't afford the way of payment at this time. There was only the option to pay with credit card. I was still in school and credit card's are not the usual way to pay something in my country, only less amount of people had one. They cost money and you don't need them in normal life. I searched for SB in local stores but couldn't found it. During studies there were lack of time to occupy with SB. Some months ago there were another reason to get a credit card. In addition to that I found a pleasant type of credit card I didn't know before. I decided to get one (SB was one of these two reasons). After using it for the other reason I went to SB-Homepage to buy SB. I noticed there is no lifetime license anymore ....<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Mr.X wrote:</cite>Forget about clumsy analogies or costs involved in a production of a software such as Sandboxie. The point here is on the consumer side not the producer side. What the consumer perceives and feels about purchasing anything:<br>
Buying 4 hamburgers = 15 Euros<br>
Buying 1 year license = 15 Euros<br>
<br>
For me it's crystal clear I wouldn't think twice, license price is a bargain. Period. Any other argument against this is a mere excuse to justify stinginess...  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"></div></blockquote>
Might be true if you eat hamburgers every day and use SB-Full version features very often. In last 10 years I have eaten less than 4 hamburgers and there were about 10 times were I could benefit from the full-version of SB. Paying 150€ for it isn't worth it. And would be more than 10 times more than the money I spend on hamburgers. People and software usage are different.<br>
<br>
There is no stinginess at my side I would pay much more for the lifetime license to never consider it again and keep it done. Currently as a consumer I perceive the uncertainty if I should buy it or not. Lifetime license  would change that.<br>
<br>
There is also no argument about a lifetime license for 100€ with 10-activations at the same time (or something like that). With this offer they probably will earn more money per user because I'm pretty sure the average use time with the annual payment is less than 6 years.(for short term user they can still offer 15€ per year of course)</div>

				<div class="content">The thing here is how people is motivated to purchase something, the underlying psychology acting under people's thought patterns, specifically purchase and satisfaction patterns.<br>
The thing here is how people feels about purchasing something. Purchase a couple of sport shoes, beautiful and comfortable, expensive btw, and they "feel" (emotions) instant satisfaction, then they forget those shoes a week later.<br>
What does people feel when purchasing a 1 year license of Sandboxie program? Not much satisfaction, they don't realize the peace of mind in return when their privacy and sensitive data, not to mention pc tech fees when OS is damaged, are saved and safe. So how much a sport shoes maker spends to sell their product or all the things you can say about software companies (whether the owns the original code and re-sell it again, bla bla bla) is irrelevant.<br>
The point is how do you (and people in general) feel about purchasing tangible goods vs intangible goods. From my pov, people needs more education, or... learn by the hard way (getting infected and all the consequences of such infection).</div>

				<div class="content">I think it would help Sandboxie grow if they take advantage of a limited time sale following a some recommendations.<br>
<br>
To get a lifetime license, you have to do the following:<br>
Call it: <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The Chance of a Lifetime!</strong></span><br>
○Buy a 1 year license<br>
○Refer 3 friends to the 1 year license by New Years Eve. (This license could go on sale 2 days before the lifetime deal is announced)<br>
(optional) ○If someone started the <em>referall</em> process but did not bring 3 new people to enlightenment before the deadline, they can still "Save a Lifetime" if they complete some additional requirement(s), such as referring 7 additional people.<br>
<br>
Should you consider it?<br>
Would you like see your yearly customers skyrocket?<br>
It can make Sandboxie gold, if done right.</div>

Bo, thanks for your explanation but I really don't think people currently don't know about the hard and ongoing updation a good quality software undergoes. Much less people that understand or barely understand Sandboxie added value. I perceive, in this case (SandboxieUser42), a mere trolling posts, otherwise this user needs to self-educate quite a bit more.<br>
<br>
@anyone<br>
For any other beggars trying to be cheap (sorry for being rude), remember my clumsy analogy already posted:<br>
Buying 4 hamburgers (satisfies hunger for 5 hours) = 15 Euros<br>
Buying 1 year license (peace of mind about safety of your personal/sensible data for 365 days)= 15 Euros<br>
<br>
Do a self-analysis on how you feel about buying software licenses (intangible) vs any other stuff (mostly useless). This is a matter of how consumer feels when purchasing not a dissertation about the processes to produce goods/services vs. software. If you still feeling bad for purchasing a Sandboxie license then you need to re-educate yourself on this matter.</div>

That's true, I'm on your side. I'm willed to pay more for SB than hamburgers.<br>
Take Microsoft Windows as an example. You buy Version "...", you can use it as long as you want. At some time the next version will apear and you can upgrade your old OS to the new one.<br>
They made a lot of money with this kind of selling. So why not with SB?<br>

W T F ?????</div></blockquote>
So tell me please one thing a developer need to done, which hinder me using it for infinite amount of time.<br>
There is no more work to be done to maintain the capability on a static system. I'm able to use it as long I want without any work done by the devs (example please, if you think not).<br>
In normal usage a static system is an unreal behaviour. Over time the programs, functions and content I use will change. Incompatibility and/or errors may appear.<br>
I might can live with that. If not I could buy an update for SB.<br>
So please add at least a lifetime version without updates.<br>
<br>
You may also compute the average usage time of an user, add some profit constants and multiply it by the annual usage cost.<br>
Even if you say 120 (years of human life) times 15€ is 1800€. There will still some people who would buy this. To maximize profit a lower price would<br>
probably be more valuable. As I told before I would pay about 100€ for it. I am pretty sure that it's more than you get from an average user.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>bo.elam wrote:</cite>SandboxieUser42, maintaining Sandboxie is continous work, it never stops.

So, they did an update. If I need it, I am willing to pay for it (as I wrote before). If I don't need the added feature/function and can live with some incompatibility and/or errors there is no reason<br>
to pay for something I don't need. <br>

</div></blockquote>
As I wrote several times before I would pay for these updates if I need them. So, please do not argue against something that no one had said. <br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Mr.X wrote:</cite>

As I wrote  several times before I'm willed to pay more than the average user, just not every year.<br>

It's still an unfitting comparison because you need to produce the whole hamburger every time (the soup as well). But let's take this as an initial cost (for SB). If I want some improvements of the hamburger, the cost of that would be small compared to the hamburger (cost for upgrades).<br>
So in Software you could have an initial cost for all work already done and a smaller cost for updates. <br>
More fitting example would be your hardware system. You can run it as long you want. Over time the performance becomes worse and you can buy an upgrade for your PC.<br>
<br>
--<br>
I'm willed to pay for SB and for updates. I am also willing to pay for it before the work has been done.<br>
One year is just a too short time.</div>
