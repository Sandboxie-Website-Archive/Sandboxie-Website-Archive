				<div class="content">Update: I've ignored my own advise, and added simple DDE support to SandboxieReflector.  This will allow you to also reflect file and protocol associations which rely on DDE to transfer the correct data to the receiving app.  Note that setting this up will not be as easy as setting up simple command line reflecting, so it's probably only for the more experienced users.<br>
<br>
I didn't want to spend a lot of time on this and thus I resorted to a hack (for the DDE insiders: I just pass on the WM_DDE_INITIATE message unmodified from the Reflector to the target app and be done with it), so I do not know if it will work all the time on all platforms.  It does work on Windows XP though.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
A slight update for something I got fed up with real quickly: SandboxieReflector now automatically reloads it's settings is you change the settings file.  Should save you some hassle with continuously restarting the Effectuator each time you're adding new profiles <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"></div>

				<div class="content">Thanks a lot for this utility. I was looking for something like this for <a href="../phpbb/viewtopicb331.php?t=9514" class="postlink">a long time</a>. It helps me a lot, and it would help me even more if I were a more knowledge user (I am trying to open eml files in the Windows Live Mail's sandbox but the "/eml:" parameter makes me mad because the file path is always taken with two double quotes).<br>
<br>
But I have experimented some Effectuator crashes. <a href="../phpbb/viewtopic38ea.php?t=12848" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=12848</a><br>

Thanks MichaelS for recommending "Default Programs Editor" too.</div>

				<div class="content">Carl, I wished to thank you for SandboxieReflector.  <br>
<br>
It has enabled me to find a secure way for my wife to use a sandboxed Firefox browser while ensuring she <strong>automatically</strong> calls forth  Trusteer Rapport functionality (not available sandboxed) in an unsandboxed browser when clicking in sandboxed Firefox for various sensitive sites she accesses regularly.  [Full details, should you be interested: <a href="../phpbb/viewtopicf85a.php?p=81977#81977" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/phpbb/viewtopi ... 1977#81977</a>].<br>
<br>
Mine is perhaps an unorthodox use of your utility, but I believe with good intention.<br>
<br>
Thank you, particularly for your simple and clear instructions that someone only familiar with some programming fundamentals was eventually able to apply with great success to obtain the result required.</div>

				<div class="content">Would it be possible for the people that got SandboxieReflector running successfully with an app either sandboxed in another sandbox or running outside any sandbox share some detailed information on the steps to achieve this?<br>
<br>
Even though I am at times coding away little sites as a past time I find the little documentation too steep to follow as of now, even though I have been digging into it and got a few minor results already.<br>
<br>
I guess js, $, html5 and such do not have that much to do with dos and shell and the registry so a completely different area really.<br>
<br>
I am not interested in security breaches or any malicious activity, on the contrary I would love to be able to have Office and Email and Browser "talk" to each other, either all sandboxed individually or just the browser and email and, unfortunately as it stands now I will have to accept that Office will need to be run from the drive, unsandboxed.<br>
<br>
Help in this area would not only be appreciated by myself looking at the many topics of people that like to run certain apps in individual sandboxes or outside of a sandbox.<br>
<br>
Even pointing to good learning resources, tuts, links or helping topics about how to get SandboxieReflector to run (I guess learning dos and shell commands??) or how to get it to communicate with apps would be tremendously appreciated.<br>
<br>
I am not looking for a solution served ready made, NO, happy to learn this myself but would love at least for some guidance or feedback or ideas shared.<br>
<br>
Thanks to anyone that feels to chip in here. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"></div>
