				<div class="content">As with all things sandboxie, it contains just about <span style="text-decoration: underline">everything</span> in the box. This means that it won't be able to spread to the actual system [outside of poorly designed 'Open' rules that a user would need to ADD <strong>manually</strong>] but if you happen to use a persistent sandbox [eg, if it doesn't delete itself every time the apps are closed] it's possible that something might last 'inside' and I believe this a large part of why they discourage the use of such sandboxes. If you set it to delete every time the program is closed, any potential 'passengers', eg malware etc, are removed at that point.<br>
<br>
Does this mean that your <span style="text-decoration: underline">data</span> is 100% safe?<br>
Once again, outside of poorly designed openfiles/paths, ransom-ware won't be able to [actually] encrypt your stuff... [though it might still think it did]<br>
While it does keep the <em>bad stuff</em> from gaining a 'foothold' on your system by default it doesn't prevent it from running (though there are extra rules you can add manually to aid in this). It's as easy as deleting a box to remove anything that might be inside.<br>
<br>
Will sandboxie ensure your data (you can mitigate this one by blocking read access to folders/files within SBIE), screen or keystrokes aren't harvested while a baddie is running inside? ~ NO!<br>
It has its limits and I'm one of those weirdos who like to remind people that 'SBIE' alone is not a -cure all-...<br>
If it is (as claimed at several points on this forum), then why do they sell Invincea X to the business users where containment is only an 'option'?<br>
The answer (I think) is easy, they actually agree with me and AV/SBIE alone doesn't <strong>stop</strong> everything.<br>
<br>
It's a great way to keep your system clean...but that doesn't mean that some type of baddie won't be able to <span style="text-decoration: underline">temporarily</span> harvest something while running within. [but apparently home users shouldn't worry about this...]<br>
<br>
If you have the (correct) rules set up though, it can certainly keep your system safe and that's why I love it! I had to open up a few paths on my Kids PC for usability that I'm not really comfortable with but as it'll be a while before [hopefully it'll get replaced before then] s/he has important documents.<br>
<em><br>
I suppose nowadays the teachers might accept 'ransom-ware encrypted my homework' before they fall for the 'my dog ate my homework' excuse....</em><br>
<br>
Outside of forcing stuff and a few related templates (and perhaps the nagging 'countdown' after a time) the free version works exactly like the paid version. [Hopefully I'm not forgetting a restriction]</div>

I feel safe with my rules inside Sandboxie. I blocked most entry points, eg browsers, media players, document software [think office but I don't use that] via ClosedFilePath s and so I don't use any type of Anti-Ransomware.<br>
<br>
I won't say that you <em>shouldn't</em>, but <em> if you spend enough time setting things up (the paths) with SBIE, there may not be a need. Each setup is different though so that's a tough one to answer.<br>
If you are unsure or just want to be safe 'just in case' I can't see the harm in adding something like that though I haven't tested it with my setup.</em></div>

				<div class="content">I can't say for sure. I've avoided facebook for years and while I heard they now have another (separate) app for messenger I likely can't try it without an account and tbh I'm just too lazy to install it in a VM atm just to find out.<br>
<br>
The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Download-Facebооk-Messenger-663901636980293/" class="postlink">download link found here</a> seems to [eventually] point to an exe which implies to me that it is a regular 'desktop' app rather than an AppX/Metro type which SBIE doesn't currently guard. If that's the case [if it is a normal exe] I<span style="text-decoration: underline"> see no reason why SBIE can't protect it like any other desktop app</span> if you define it as forced (paid) or choose 'Run Sandboxed' from the context menu....<br>
<br>
While I believe in prevention before containment I don't believe in no containment.... /confusing eh?<br>
<br>
So I'd say go ahead, try it in SBIE..there's a decent chance that it'll work.<br>
<br>
Short answer: I see no reason why you can't use the Malwarebytes Anti-Ransomware with Sandboxie.<br>
Long answer: Is it needed? Maybe not, it depends on your setup and the rules in play with Sandboxie. If you want to be extra safe though, I can't see the harm.</div>

yeah so I kinda messed up with the other responses...and went waay off target there, I ramble a lot.<br>
<br>
I would expect (but can not guarantee) that the messenger app WILL work inside SBIE (sometimes a bit of tweaking might be needed) so I see no reason to avoid using it inside SBIE if it runs.</div>

I haven't tested it, if it runs in SBIE go for it! That goes both for the browser you access facebook through and the new messaging app which I haven't tested. If it runs inside the sandbox, your SYSTEM is safe.</div>

As always, Sandboxie will 'contain', but 'block' isn't something you should expect.</div>

I hope so as well, drop a line here if not and I'll take a look tomorrow (while actually sober) if you run into problems! Good Luck!!!!</div>
