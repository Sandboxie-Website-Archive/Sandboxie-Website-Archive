				<h3>[.01] Google Chrome 28 + Sandboxie = new bug</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Thu Jul 11, 2013 2:18 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>justaGuest</strong></div>
				<div class="content">i have 2 computers with sandboxie and chrome for years, today chrome got updated to 28 on both computers.<br>
new bug appeared on both machines (one is XP the second is Win7):<br>
<br>
select TAG (html code), any select code will not have it's good looking chrome style, but an ugly Windows 2000ish look, it effects every select tag as much as i know, when<br>
opening chrome without sandboxie, it loads the style as it should.<br>
<br>
sandbox is clear.<br>
all cache has been removed from the original chrome, no cookies or any old data.<br>
everything is fresh, both computer has the same sandbug.<br>
<br>
hope you get it fixed, its not an urgent issue, just annoying abit.<br>
Thanks from advance!</div>

no lol i didn't mean select tag.. i meant &lt;select&gt; in html coding doesn't have the desired style with sandboxie.<br>
including scroll bar.<br>
you can't select it, just to go a website that uses that code inside the HTML or look to your left/right and see that your scroll for the page has Win2000 style.<br>
<br>
2 different machines, XP + Win7 - works fine without sandboxie, the bug is only with the sandboxie from chrome ver.28.</div>

				<div class="content">When chrome is sandboxed the scrollbars and other parts of a website change a bit...for example look closely at the image below, scrollbars and login button change...why is this happening?<br>

				<div class="content">This will be fixed in the next beta version I release.  I don't know what changed in Chrome to cause this problem but in version 28 it seems the Visual Styles DLL is not loading into the sandboxed Chrome.  Loading it explicitly seem to fix the problem.</div>
