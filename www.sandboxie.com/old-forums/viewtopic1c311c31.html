				<div class="content">I keep getting "Payment not authorized for Sandboxie - Home Use Lifetime License (5 Computers)" when attempting to pay via PayPal or pre-paid credit card.<br>
I only get generic form-letter emails with no indication of what the specific problem is.<br>
I have replied to the emails asking for specifics but I am not holding my breath.<br>
<br>
You really need to sort out Cleverbridge's problems or move to a different payment processor ..... you are probably losing lots of customers who just give up and walk away. <br>
In 25 years of buying things on the internet I have never had this much trouble.</div>

				<div class="content">I would advise you to contact cleverbridge directly or possible PayPal. We haven't had any issues with them, and they have been used for many years.<br>

				<div class="content">Clevebridge resolved the problem and sent me a confirmation email. I have bought Sandboxie with PayPal. I did not have to do or change anything at my end. They did not tell me the cause of the problem.</div>
