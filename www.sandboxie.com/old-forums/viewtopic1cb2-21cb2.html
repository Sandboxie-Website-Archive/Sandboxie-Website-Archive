				<div class="content">Timefreeze and Deep Freeze seem way too cumbersome to me. I'm not trying to replace Sandboxie (haha, no way), I'm just hearing a lot about the Deep Freeze so I wondered what's so good about it. Having to reboot every time to make things go back to the initial state doesn't seem too practical to me. But it's true that I don't know much about the program in question.<br>
<br>
Thank you.</div>

Hi Bellzemos. Of the programs mentioned in this thread, I used Toolwiz Time freeze and for the past few years, I have been using Shadow defender in both of my computers. I think both programs work great and recommend both. You should get one of them as I believe every Windows user ought to have something like them in their computer.<br>
<br>
In my case, I use Sandboxie for security. And use Shadow defender for trying programs that don't require a reboot. I also use Shadow defender when I want to try a change in the system that I am not to sure about. So, to me, they are different and I use them for totally different purposes. <br>
<br>
And Bellzemos. This type of program are easy to use and can be used along Sandboxie, there's no conflict whatsoever (Shadow defender or Toolwiz Time Freeze). <br>
<br>
Bo</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you Bo. I like the overall look of the Shadow Defender but I think I don't need it really. I use Sandboxie for security and for testing out new software. I remember years ago when I didn't know about Sandboxie and was using 5 security products and still got malware on the PC. Now all I have is a free antivirus and Sandboxie (and a bit of common sense of course). <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

				<div class="content">+1 for lightweight solutions and common sense. I run Firefox in Sandboxie with NoScript, RequestPolicy and AdblockPlus addons. Keep everything up to date and keep things like flash click to enable. I was tempted to add AppGuard to the mix but honestly I've not had anything get through the NoScript/RequestPolicy barrier yet never mind Sandboxie (which I value for it's ability to keep my system clean as much as for defence).<br>
<br>
If I'm doing anything particularly risky, e.g. testing software, I jump on a VM with a similar setup as above.</div>

Best use of Deep Freeze(SD or Time Freeze) is when testing software which can't be installed within SBIE, been using Time Freeze(Always On) just because I don't want my kids to mess things when they use the PC. Also have SD but stopped using it as it conflicts with AX64 Time Machine...</div>

This is why I prefer Shadow Defender. You can use it on Standard or Admin account.</div>

I've tested Shadow Defender on my live system a few times using the RAM option as it sounded perfect but it slowed everything down to a crawl each time so it's been a no go here. I've yet to find a single 'light virtualization' program that works well on my setup. It's always one thing or another... =(<br>
<br>
SBIE and VMWare Workstation cover most of my bases anyhow but it'd be nice to have another option to test software that requires a driver (without a reboot or full virtualization)</div>
