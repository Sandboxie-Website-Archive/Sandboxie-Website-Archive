				<div class="content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I'm brand new to the forum and have searched far and wide for an answer to this question before giving in and posting this thread.<br>
<br>
I am trying to run 2 instances of Halo: Combat Evolved on my computer. I have been successful by having 1 running on the computer and 1 in sandboxie. The problem is I would like to use 2 separate controllers to control each instance simultaneously. It seems like the controllers will only work with the window being 'active' (selected) and as soon as you deselect that window by selecting another one - it loses the usb input to it.<br>
<br>
Any help would be greatly appreciated,<br>
<br>

You may want to look online for multi-seat solutions and see if that helps:<br>

<br>
Multi-seat solutions require 2 video cards to be able to work. That being said, the only other solution mentioned in the other topics was a piece of software that is more for 2 PCs using one keyboard and mouse. The question remains open.<br>
<br>
If anyone else has any experience or information on this matter it would be amazing to get this working. Thanks for your time in advance,<br>
