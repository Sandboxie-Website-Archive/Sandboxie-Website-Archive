				<div class="content">Now that I remember there is one option I would like, I think I told you about it before. I would like something like a small box in the GUI that we could tick or a setting in the Menu bar that we can click to set Sandboxie control to stay on top of all other windows. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">  <br>

I agree with quite a few of member Special's suggestions<br>
<br>
The interface as it is now works quite well, and can only presume you are thinking about a flat Win 10 GUI  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad"> <br>

				<div class="content">Unless I've mis-read the original post I think things have gotten a tad off course here with more attention paid to the title instead of the text it actually contained. I might as well jump on board though! I have no issue with the removal that was initially suggested, can't say I've EVER used it myself.<br>
<br>
There were a few (user) proposed changes I agreed with, especially related to options in the internal context menus or the use of tabs in some spots - those made sense.<br>
<br>
"Please don't kill the pizza slice in the taskbar!!" however is one I have to at least suggest a compromise for.<br>
<br>
My <a href="viewtopicaa80aa80.php?f=4&amp;p=96215" class="postlink">first post EVER</a> here was about how much I abhorred it..Followed by a not so nice exchange with some old timers who likely still hate me.<br>
<br>
So, how about using a resource file that could be edited/replace at the users whim with a default icon set installed that includes the current 'Pizza Slice'. This would allow those of us who would rather have 'other' icons (In my case, they would be the silly set I shared long ago based on your logo) to simply replace/edit a single resource file, without breaking any digital signatures, and still keep the 'default Pizza' [I love pizza, I just don't like it in my notification area] for everyone else?</div>

<br>
The reason for me why the icon is so fundamental to the program is that there is no other taskbar icon I can think of where it is so blatantly obvious what state of use the program is in.<br>
<br>
A brief glance and you <em>know</em> if the program is in use. Iconic icons (can I say that?) are rare.</div>

/me throws icecream across the table.<br>
<br>
The great thing about my 'compromise' idea is that the pizza icon would remain the default so those who like it already, win, you don't have to change anything. You get your standard yellow icons but it still allows those of us who don't enjoy it to have our 'cake' [instead of pizza] and eat it too. :P<br>
<br>
I think the ones I came up around the time Invincea took over are pretty good at being obvious with what state the program is in but that could just be because I know what they are since I created them. :-/<br>
<br>
So for the first 'public' time ever I'll release these 'old' mock ups (haven't touched them since) <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/fu5tt31fcdxju9s/SBIE.7z" class="postlink">HERE</a><br>
<br>
They aren't perfect by any means but they blend in much better for my personal preferences.  (/me prepares to be laughed at)</div>

				<div class="content">i would like to have the groups visible - not only as a selector (upper right)<br>
group1<br>
- box1<br>
- box2<br>
group2<br>
- box3<br>
- box4<br>
<br>
<br>
and i really would appreciate a fix for the german translation concerning groups<br>
the selector shows "(Oben)" but that is nonsense - it should be "(Alle)" because it shows not "up" (or upper) boxes it shows all.<br>
<br>
concerning the UI - i dont really have changes in mind. if you like to insert ribbons then it may happen - but it would blow the UI a bit. then i suggest to have an option to auto-collapse or auto-expand the mentioned groups (see above).<br>
groups are shown in the menu "sandbox" but not visible in the UI.<br>
<br>
again layout and grouping - please add a "up" and "down" button right side instead context menu. addition "rename" "delete" " and "add" for a new sandbox. all in one layout.<br>
<br>
what i miss are buttons "delete" "open" "kill tasks" when a box is selected (not hovered), instead using the context menu. i have a small control unit from outside which offers me some functions for boxes. my usage of sandboxie is more experimental and investigative than forcing boxed programs so i use those 3 options very often.<br>
<br>
maybe you can add an option for export registry. there are tools that can export a reghive to a reg file but those are no perfect and have bugs. the small one here is off the web for years now and no source available (some1 passed it to me).<br>
<br>
cheers</div>
