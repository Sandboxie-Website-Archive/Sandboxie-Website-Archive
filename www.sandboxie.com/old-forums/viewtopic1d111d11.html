				<h3>The new &quot;2015&quot; licensing terms</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello!<br>
<br>
I welcome back the personal lifetime license, I think and hope you will be able to get more customers this way.<br>
<br>
I have two questions:<br>
<br>
1. The old lifetime licenses will still be honored as in terms of that they can be used on all the computers the users own? I myself bought the license in 2010 or so and am using it on two computers of mine.<br>
<br>
2. Are there any plans in lowering the annual price of Sandboxie license for the commercial use? Maybe a lower price for the first (testing) year? I know customers who would probably be willing to try it for the first year and when they see and understand the quality of Sandboxie they would be willing to pay the full annual price the next year. And in case they don't, they can delete and stop using it after a year.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thank you and keep up the good work!<br>
<br>
Also, I wish everyone on this forum a happy, healthy and successful 2015! <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

I'm questioning first question as Bellzemos is. I purchased two Lifetime Licenses on the following dates:<br>
1. Aug. 12, 2013<br>
2. Dec. 13, 2014<br>
<br>
Hope you still honored those licenses as per former terms of licensing.</div>

				<div class="content">Hope you don't mind me adding my question in your thread Bellzemos:<br>
<br>
I'm tempted by the 3x lifetime license bundle as I run VM's which could benefit from the protection and ease of testing software sandboxie brings. As the VM's are often wiped and may appear to have different hardware from time to time; are licenses in any way transferable to different machines? I believe Dun asked this question previously but is there a way to de-register sandboxie on one machine and re-register it on another?<br>
<br>
Only information I could find was:<br>
<span style="color: #FF4000"><strong>Q. Do I need to license (pay for) Sandboxie multiple times, to use it on more than one computer at home?</strong><br>
A. Yes. You can use a single product key (which corresponds to a single license) of Sandboxie <strong>on one computer at a time</strong>. This does not apply to non-personal use (including commercial, educational, governmental, and not-for-profit use).<br>
<br>
further down:<br>
<br>
The licensing terms for Sandboxie are not affected by Product Key Activation: <strong>The Product Key for a personal license can be activated on any number of computers that you personally own, whether physical or virtual computers</strong>.  Note that an activated license is tied to a specific computer and version of Sandboxie, and is set to expire after some period of time. However, Sandboxie will automatically renew your license as necessary, without any action on your part.<br>
</span><br>
<br>
Thanks,</div>

All licenses are honored by the terms under which they were sold.</div>

				<div class="content">Virtual machine is pretty good question. I think it would be good to create image backup where Sandboxie is activated and then restore it when is needed. I'll do some AV and malware tests soon so I will such image too.<br>
If you often need to change VM hardware then dunno... If you have the 'old' (unlimited) lifetime license like you posted then having many activations is not a crime. I just hope they will not block key if number of activations exceed any number  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">

Unfortunately I don't have an old license type, just a 1yr subscription currently. <br>
<br>
Thinking about it, if the license isn't transferable to other machines then I guess lifetime license really means lifetime of the computer (something I didn't consider). I was thinking I could get the 3xbundle and use one on my laptop... If the license expires with the laptop then there's little point in me installing the paid version of sandboxie as my laptop is old and will either be replaced or become unused before the years out.<br>
<br>
Another question, if I upgrade my machine e.g. add more RAM or a better processor, and then reinstall windows, will that mean I'd need a new lifetime license as the machine ID would be different?<br>
<br>
I guess I'll either hold off on buying until ageing computers have been replaced or buy the bundle and store some licenses away for future computers.. hmmm<br>
<br>
(I still appreciate the option of a lifetime license. Just trying to understand exactly how it works)</div>

				<div class="content">Glad that you are now offering lifetime licensing for this gem again.   Appreciate the continued support for SBIE too.   I'm already a lifetime member, but still, for those that are not, it's well worth it.   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

				<div class="content">I only today discovered that lifetime licenses are back and I'm very pleased. Pleased enough to register on the forum, make a post and pay for a license or five!<br>
<br>
I'm likely to recommend other people to buy a license too...<br>
