				<div class="content">As many of you have probably seen already, Invincea is happy to announce that it has been acquired by Sophos.  The full press release can be found here:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.invincea.com/2017/02/sophos-to-acquire-invincea-to-add-industry-leading-machine-learning-to-its-next-generation-endpoint-protection-portfolio/" class="postlink">https://www.invincea.com/2017/02/sophos ... portfolio/</a><br>
<br>
Many of you are probably wondering, what does this mean for Sandboxie and its users?<br>
<br>
The answer as of right now, is that nothing is changing.  We will continue to operate as we have since Invincea acquired Sandboxie.  We have no current plans to discontinue developing Sandboxie updates or supporting it.<br>
<br>
We will also continue to post updates and any changes that come later to the forums.<br>
<br>
Thank you all for being loyal Sandboxie customers and we look forward to continuing to protect your computers.</div>
