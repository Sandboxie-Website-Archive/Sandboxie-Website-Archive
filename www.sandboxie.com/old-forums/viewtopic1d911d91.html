				<div class="content">Although there are lots of reports about this or that program not running properly (and I have posted a few myself!), all in all this program has saved me so much time and protected my system against all sorts of nasties when browsing and downloading stuff to test. And isn't it wonderful to be able to just dump, run and test a program in the sandbox without the rest of the "real" system getting stuffed full of junk files and registry entries that Windows never seems to get rid of after uninstalling? <br>
<br>
I think this is a one man job of work - so it really is good work to keep up with the constantly changing world of software and the devious ways in which our computers are being attacked. I can't get my Orb program to run sandboxed but I'll just have to wait! In the meantime, just about everything else works! Thanks for making my life so much easier and for saving me so much time.</div>
