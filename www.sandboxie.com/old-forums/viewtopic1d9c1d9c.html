				<div class="content">I am posting here after a long time indeed. I want to suggest a feature. excuse me in advance if it has already been discussed.<br>
<br>
Pls add a rather huge white list in SBIE with an option to force all unknown applications sandboxed. When an unknown application will run, it will be sandbxed and an alert will come from the tray telling that xyz.exe is unknown and has been sandboxed. This balloon alert can be disabled too.<br>
<br>
Or there may be an option to get a pop up alert when an unknown application tries to run, SBIE can offer to run it in sandbox.<br>
<br>
The auto-sandbox feature should be disabled by default but any one, if interested, can enable it.</div>

<br>
I don't think there's any need to complicate the simplicity behind Sandboxie. I also don't see why such would be needed.<br>
<br>
If you sandbox the dangerous applications (web browser, e-mail client, media player, image viewer, messenger, etc), then everything else will also become sandboxed.<br>
<br>
If you'd like to run an application unsandboxed, e.g web browser, but would still like to have other applications forced, such as PDF reader when you open a PDF file from within the web browser, then you could subscribe to my feature suggestion here <a href="../phpbb/viewtopicede5.php?t=10281" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=10281</a><br>
<br>
As it is right now, even if you have e.g. PDF reader forced to its own sandbox, it will run unsandboxed. It would be nice to have it forced to its sandbox, if initiated by an unsandboxed process.<br>
<br>
Would this approach be something within what you'd like Sandboxie to offer? Otherwise, what you're suggesting would make of Sandboxie a more complicated application, IMHO.<br>
<br>
Then again, only Tzuk can say for sure whether or not something that would play nice. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"></div>
