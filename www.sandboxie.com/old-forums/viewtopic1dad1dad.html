				<div class="content">So i'm trying to set up sandboxie to run League Of Legends, however it seems that since the processes between 2 clients get shared before the game runs only one user can actually enter the game, or to explain it better, both the games end up on one screen and not on two different screens. i've tried looking for soltuions and it seems like its a VM problem in general for league and not just sandboxie, so if anyone knows how or has run it please help</div>

				<div class="content">The Software vendor may prohibit the same instance of the game running at once. Sandboxie does not had you from the software detecting this. Sandboxie is well known, and many vendors do not permit it. <br>
You may also be violating the software's EULA and/or the ToS.<br>
<br>
You may try a VM. Sandboxie is not that either.</div>

				<div class="content">I see, so it's basically limited to the vendor... I have a support ticket asking about whether it is allowed or not in LoL and i'm currently awaiting an answer, however i asked another game company, Blizzard for OverWatch and was basically told its in a gray zone, where they cant say its allowed or not and so worst case scenario a ban but to which i can probably appeal towards. As for league there is a workaround that i managed to get working but its somewhat a hassle, where 6 processes run and you gotta terminate them all except for one and re-run the game in order to get it to work on both terminals. <br>
<br>
I'm using both Sandboxie and Aster to try and accomplish this.</div>
