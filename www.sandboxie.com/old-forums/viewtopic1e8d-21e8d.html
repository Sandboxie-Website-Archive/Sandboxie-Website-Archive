				<h3>Find sandboxed application in Uninstall Program</h3>

				<div class="content"><strong>I cannot find certain sandboxed programs in the "Uninstall a program" window in Windows 7 (64 bit).<br>
<br>
Specifically, can't find certain programs in either sandboxed "Uninstall a program" window (in Windows Explorer), or in non-sandboxed "Uninstall a program" window (again, in Windows Explorer, of course).<br>
<br>
Also, the ones I can't find are all, I believe, recovered; that is, they were initially installed into the sandbox, and then recovered out by me. Yet, once recovered out, they are to be found in neither of the "Uninstall a program" windows--i.e., either sandboxed or not sandboxed (going through Control Panel).<br>
<br>
Where did the uninstall location go?<br>
<br>
Thank you--. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></strong></div>

				<div class="content">You can copy the folders and files of programs that were installed in a sandbox, but the Registry entries that were made when those programs were installed remain in the sandbox Reghive files. Including the Uninstall Registry entries.<br>
And those Registry entries are not added to your "real" Registry if you copy the files out of the sandbox.<br>
<br>
There's no provision made to add those entries to your Registry - as Buster said, you must re-install the program.</div>
