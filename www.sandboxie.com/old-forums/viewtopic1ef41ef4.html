				<div class="content">Hi Guys, I'm just getting my head around it - checking out some of your helpful stuff already on the forum, but there's a few things I cant quite work out.<br>
<br>
I've set my browser to auto run when I click on it. (I'm a registered user) - seems to work well, however am I right in thinking that the browser and extensions wont update - as the browser will automatically go back to its original state after I delete the default sandbox??<br>
<br>
And.. I do a lot of FTP'ing with the web work I do - downloading and uploading files to various websites. Now if I made my FTP program run under sandboxie, and then downloaded a few big files - I'm guessing it would be saving them in the protected zone in sandboxie (my SSD) - and not the folder on my secondary drive..?? - would installing sandboxie on my secondary drive be a better option??</div>

Yes, all changes made to the Sandbox browser will be gone when you delete the contents. You should always update your applications outside Sandboxie to avoid issues, and immediately delete the Sandbox contents in order to start fresh (otherwise, you will most likely encounter error messages) .<br>

You can choose the location of your Sandbox (just remember that if you do not recover the files, they will be gone after you delete the contents) :<br>
Open Sandboxie Control<br>
Click on Sandbox--&gt; Set Container Folder<br>
Select the desired location<br>
<br>
Also, you can allow Sandboxed applications to directly modify your host (do this at your own risk) by following these steps:<br>
