				<div class="content">I just wanted to express my appreciation for this program - I really feel safer now surfing on the Internet. I have to say it was a bit difficult for me to figure out at first (I don't think the control settings are very intuitive for relative beginners) but I posted a question on the forum and got a helpful answer right away. I echo a previous posters' comment to read the startup guide carefully.<br>
<br>
Also, my computer guy was installing more memory on my laptop today and noticed I had sandboxie on it - he said "That's a GREAT program! Everyone should have it!"  - just thought you'd like to hear an entirely unsolicited review! (He also seemed impressed that I even HAD it, btw - guess I haven't wowed him with my computer acumen, haha)<br>
<br>
So, if I can do it, ANYBODY can, and SHOULD! Thanks  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
