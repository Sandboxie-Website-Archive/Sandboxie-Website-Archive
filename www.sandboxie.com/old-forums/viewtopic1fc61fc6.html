				<div class="content">I switched over to using the Opera 9.02 browser and I was kind of wondering if at all possible you could add a shortcut/hotkey link for automatically opening the <strong>Firefox</strong> and <strong>Opera</strong> browser just as you have for <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>. Seeing as how these are "The Big Three" I think it would be ideal for some of us who still have to constantly switch between using two different browsers for some websites.</div>

This already exists as a feature for registered users.<br>
<br>
You would just open the Sandboxie Control interface and then go to Configuration/Sandbox Settings/Set Forced Programs.  There you will find check boxes to automatically sandbox (force) Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Avant Browser, Maxthon Browser, Outlook Email and Outlook Express Email.<br>
<br>
With a registered version of Sandboxie, you can also add settings to the config file manually to "force" almost any program to always open in the sandbox.  The command to do that for notepad would be:<br>
<br>
ForceProcess=Notepad.exe<br>
<br>
If you don't have a registered version and are not ready to register it, there is an alternative using Windows shortcuts with non-registered copies of Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
Just create a separate shortcut for each of the programs you want to open automatically in Sandboxie and then put the following code in the target field of the shortcut (replacing "c:\Windows\notepad.exe" with the fully-qualified path and filename of the program you want to start:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>"C:\Program Files\Sandboxie\Start.exe" "c:\Windows\notepad.exe"
</code></pre></div>

Hope that helps.<br>
<br>
SBIE (Happy) User</div>

I haven't registered yet since I was just playing around and the thought just popped in my head. Sorry, Thanks.</div>
