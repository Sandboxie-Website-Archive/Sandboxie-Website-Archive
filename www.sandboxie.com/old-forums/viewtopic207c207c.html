				<h3>confused... sandbox and registry? installing programs...</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Mon Oct 28, 2013 9:20 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">can someone explain to me when i install a program in a sandbox what happens to all the registry changes or additions? are they also sandboxed? or permanent?<br>
<br>
The thread is also confusing me because from what i have been led to believe after reading Sandboxie's userguide i can simply hit the RECOVER button at the end of my sandboxed session(for example if i run a sandboxed windows explorer) and all the installed files and associated changes made within that session will be copied over to the main drive into their proper places RIGHT?<br>
but from what i am reading in this thread i am not hearing that this is not the case and that files can only be restored one by one?<br>
<br>
I am also wanting to install potentially untrustworthy software onto my system and want to be able to see what the software is actually doing so having the sandbox lets me check what files and being created and where things are being saved but i still don't understand how the sandbox works and interacts with system commands sent from the installer to make registry changes or to create new processes etc etc. Is this sandbox keeping me completely safe if i was to install software with a trojan and then delete the sandbox?<br>
<br>
I came to this forum looking for info on settings to use to install programs within the sandbox, i previously recall reading something online about having to change some of the settings within sandboxie if i wanted to install programs but have yet to find this little piece of info, can anyone help?<br>
<br>
I often see my firewall popping up when installing stuff while in the sandbox asking whether to allow changes in the registry etc etc. if i allow them, will deleting the sandbox restore my registry back to normal? This is my main question hear, i'm trying to determine whether the installer can send commands outside of the sandbox which can interfere with my PC.</div>

				<div class="content">I like the way Guest10 <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"> describes on this recent thread what happens to registry changes. Read the top half of his post. I think it answers your questions about the registry and Sandboxie.<br>

<br>
To recover all files that are available for recovery all at once, select the "Select all" option that can be seen at the top right corner of the Recovery window. You cant recover programs that are installed in a sandbox that way. If you want a program that you tried in a sandbox to go to your real system, I think its best to just do the installation as they are normally done. I know people can move folders of programs installed in a sandbox out of the sandbox but I never done that or know if it does work OK.<br>
<br>
If you like to see the files that are created by programs that are running sandboxed or that you install in a sandbox, navigate to: Sandboxie control&gt;View&gt;Files and folders, <br>
<br>
The only thing that you really have to  know about settings in order to install a program in a sandbox is that you have to leave Restrictions (Sandbox settings&gt;Restrictions) as they come by default. Most programs can be installed sandboxed but not all.<br>
