				<div class="content">Running Sandboxie V4.04 32 bit on windows xp<br>
Installed Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2013 and now I am getting this error when opening a sand boxed window (running firefox browser)<br>
<br>
SBIE2335 Initialization failed for process klwtblfs.exe [11 / 5]<br>
<br>
I have tried turning off under kaspersky web monitoring but still same error code.<br>
<br>
Any thoughts on a fix?<br>
I will just delete kaspersky &amp; pick another a/v program since I LOVE sandboxie more than KAV Smile<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for suggestions.<br>

				<div class="content">Partially solved.<br>
I was running Firefox V 17 and the plug in worked for Kaspersky AV<br>
Upgraded to newest Firefox V 22 and plug in not compatible so disabled.<br>
Problem was with the plug in but ? is when they make compatible with Firefox problem likely will return.<br>
In the mean time looks like they are playing nice together.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your quick response Tzuk</div>

Problem:I installed both of them.When using KIS's right click button to scan specified files in the file manager,the option is grayed out (unavailable).windows file manager isn't sandboxed.There don't seem to be any other incompatibilities.<br>
<br>
Sandboxie 3.76 is ok.<br>
Any solutions or fix in next version?<br>

When I use sb to run ie8 in xp 32 bit, the same error occurs.<br>
<br>
SBIE2335 Initialization failed for process klwtblfs.exe [11 / 5]<br>
<br>
But if I run Sandboxed chrome, it's ok...<br>
I haven't try firefox.</div>

				<h3>Sandboxie 4.04 &amp; Kaspersky 2014 problem</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Fri Jul 12, 2013 2:44 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>TheBiggestNoob</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Windows 7, 64 bit.<br>
Sandboxie 4.04 64 bit.<br>
<br>
Sandboxie used to work fine until I installed Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 beta (kis14.0.0.4651en-us_TR_20130624).They are not compatible with each other.I get an error that says<br>
SBIE2205 Service not implemented: Win32Init.4 (C0000008)<br>
I know I'm not supposed to expect great performance from beta antivirus but I just wanted to report this issue.This is not just a browser problem.None of the programs open with Sandboxie.I tried re-installing different versions with no luck.I also reported this to Kaspersky forums.<br>
<br>
Kaspersky beta<br>

What do you mean PATCH H?  Is this just a normal Kaspersky 2013 installation with latest updates?</div>

When kaspersky 2013 installed and updated normally,<br>
it's kaspersky 13.0.1.4190(g).<br>
<br>
<img src="../s1.bild.me/bilder/260513/2446090b.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
About two days after,if you update continually,<br>
it would change to version 13.0.1.4190(h)<br>
You can see the info here:<br>
<a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/8049" class="postlink">http://support.kaspersky.com/8049</a><br>
<br>
Now I have uninstalled kaspersky and use sbie only.<br>
Much thanks for you.<br>
sbie is a good software and you are a nice man.</div>
