Hi compeqcloudy, I am also using Foxit (portable) on my W7 32 bits laptop. On my end, I haven't upgraded to their latest version, still using 6.0.2.0413 and haven't experienced any issues between SBIE 4 and Foxit. Personally, I can force Foxit to run sandboxed or run PDF files sandboxed out of the browser on my browser (FF/IE9) sandbox. What kind of problem are you having?, Is Sandboxie giving you an error?<br>

				<div class="content">In my case, PDF files open immediately when I click on them. I have been using and testing version 4 since the first beta, based on my experience using V4, I feel that Foxit is one of the programs that have behaved the best running sandboxed using the new SBIE version from day one. I recommend you check your antivirus to make sure is not causing a delay opening or closing the sandbox. I don't use scanners but when I used them, I remember some antivirus can cause a long delay opening the sandbox. Check your antivirus, it might be your problem.<br>

Hi Bo,<br>
<br>
Thanks for your advice, but i don't use any antiviru software, SBIE is safe enough for me,maybe i can try to rebuild sandboxie.ini and all sandboxs<br>

Yeah, creating a new sandbox and trying Foxit in it is a good idea. You can also try the latest beta, 4.03.03. I just installed it in my XP and I can tell you, SBIE V4 feels better today than yesterday. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"> <br>

				<h3>4.02 is buggy for me as well</h3>

<br>
I've installed v4.02 twice.  The first time, SB didn't act right, so I gave it another shot a couple of days later.  My PC is running Win7 Ultimate 64-Bit and I normally use IE9.<br>
<br>
After installation overwrite of previous version, SB would not open the browser on first try. On second try the browser opened, but it was on the taskbar without opening a window.<br>
<br>
Once after closing the browser, SB's systray icon stayed with a red "x", saying that it was deleting files. It wouldn't go back to normal until I reopened the browser much later.  I realize IE9 takes a while to fully close, but I don't think that was the issue.<br>
<br>
When I have a SB browser open and click on a link in Outlook 2007, SB opens up a new window, instead of a new tab.  Version 3.76 opens up a new tab.<br>
<br>
This happened the next morning, while clicking on a Facebook link in an opened email window in Outlook 2007:<br>
