				<div class="content">Hi, I have used the 3.58 trial version for around 7 days.. it always gave me BSOD's which is now fixed in the new beta. I just downloaded it and wanted to play around with it while having as problem: It says that half of the features are only available in the registered version and i cant use the trial anymore?<br>
<br>
thanks</div>

				<div class="content">Read this. This tells you what you get Extra. surprisingly, it's not that much. Other than the Pop-Up Screen not displaying, you'll be able to run Programs in multiple Sandboxes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Personally, I think it's worth every Dime, once you get to know how to use it.</strong><br>
<br>
You can use the Trial Version as long as you want. I've never seen the Pop-Up you're talking about. You'd have to copy the Message word for word here to get a precise answer. <br>
