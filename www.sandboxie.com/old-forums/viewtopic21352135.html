That is not a Sandboxie limitation, but a Windows one. You can find more info here:<br>
<a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-disable-taskbar-button-grouping-2626110" class="postlink">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-disable ... ng-2626110</a><br>

<br>
Please see below to find more about the features added to the paid version:<br>
<a href="../index1fc0.html?FAQ_Licensing" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?FAQ_Licensing</a><br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Q. Which features are available in the paid version?
A. Two features: 
     •  "Force" programs: Automatically run programs under Sandboxie even when they are not started directly through Sandboxie. Programs can be "forced" by name or by containing folder. 
     •  Run programs in more than one sandbox at the same time. This causes error SBIE1303 in the free version. The paid version also offers Office365 support, Office 2016 support and Office 2013 (Click2Run) Support and will also include any premium features in the future.</code></pre></div>

There are currently certain issues going on with Office, they are being worked on and we should hopefully have a fix soon. <br>
Please review these threads :<br>

Regarding dropbox, if you provide the required information, and steps you follow to use the app with Office,  I will test it:<br>

Maybe I did not explain myself clearly, but even when I set Windows taskbar to never combine, I still find that the sandboxed Chrome icons sit right next to one  another on the taskbar, and I can't drag them around individually to new positions, like I can when they are not sandboxed.</div>

I just tested the following settings in Windows 10:<br>
Right click on the Taskbar --&gt; Taskbar Settings <br>
Combine taskbar buttons: never<br>
<br>
I opened 2 windows of Google Chrome outside Sandboxie, and a third thing to try to move them around. The behavior hasn't changed, Chrome windows will move together, they cannot be separated. <br>
<br>
If you can provide different repro steps or a video of what you are doing, I will re-test the behavior.<br>

				<div class="content">I am referring specifically to dedicated Chrome windows that are of the type created by "add to desktop", "open as window".<br>
I went for the paid version, and you know what, it works, when Chrome is a "forced" app.</div>
