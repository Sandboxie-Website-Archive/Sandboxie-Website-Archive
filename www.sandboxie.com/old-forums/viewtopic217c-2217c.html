				<div class="content">i have SB installed on a few of my PC´s. and on one system i can not connect to SB website to check updates or activate.<br>
<br>
its a win 10 pro 64 bit build 1709 system.<br>
<br>
of course i have tried to completely disabled the windows firewall (thought the settings allow SB to connect, like on my other systems).<br>
<br>
a all i get from SB is an "error 12029 by 14".<br>
<br>
i am pretty puzzled and don´t know what else i could try.<br>
<br>
--------------MERGED POST---------------------------------------------<br>

<br>

Does the offline activate work? <br>
What is your Antivirus Software?<br>

				<div class="content">thx but i don´t seew how these two topics could help me. <br>
as i wrote i already have tried with the windows firewall completely deactivated. <br>
<br>
and i checked the rules i have created. there are onlyl two rules that allow SB to connect, no rule to block SB.<br>
<br>
my AV is avira. i only use the antivirus part no other modules.<br>
i have disabled the avira realtime scanner too.<br>
<br>
----------------MERGED POST --------------------------<br>
tried offline activation.... that worked. <br>
<br>
but i would like to solve this puzzle and know why SB is unable to connect from this specific system.</div>

Glad the offline activation worked!<br>
<br>
There is something on your computer blocking connections to the Sandboxie server, thus you are receiving that error.<br>
Give this a try (if there is no Firewall/Antivirus conflict):<br>

yeah well i know that much  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing">  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> <br>
<br>
but what could i t be?<br>
<br>
i build my first computer with 10 years in 1982, a ZX 81,and i would say i am pretty good at finding computer issues.<br>
<br>
but i don´t see anything external that could prevent SB from connecting.<br>
i checked the posts you linked too, did not solve the issue.<br>
<br>
i checked the host file, i removed avira, i disabled the windows firewall.<br>
and no other software has issues connecting.</div>

<br>
You can find more info about error 12029 here, it may help you determine what's blocked:<br>
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa383770(v=vs.85).aspx" class="postlink">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/librar ... s.85).aspx</a><br>
<br>
I tested disabling <strong>TLS 1.2</strong>  (looks like the default ones now are TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2) and received the exact same message you did. Try enabling that one (you can use my previous post as a guide). <br>
<br>
Another option is Restoring settings:<br>
Run inetcpl.cpl<br>
Go to "Advanced" tab<br>
Hit "Restore Advanced Settings" (This should enable the TLS settings as needed). <br>
Apply and Ok<br>
Re-test activation<br>
<br>

Barb.-</div>

i checked that before and all TLS versions are checked.<br>
<br>
resetting the advanced settings and rebooting did not change anything.<br>
<br>
i then reseted internet explorer (set back all setting to default) and suddenly.... it worked. eureka!<br>

<br>
the strange thing is i never use IE. i use chrome and firefox. so i don´t know what could have changed settings.</div>
