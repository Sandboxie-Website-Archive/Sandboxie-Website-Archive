Thats a false positive. Sometimes Jiangmin flags the SBIE installer too. Same identical detection, probably it uses same engine and definitions as Tencent. Dont worry about it, you can ignore it. <br>

Thanks for your reply.<br>
<br>
Sorry, but Chrome tells nonsense (as quite often). And Firefox starts the download without any problem. Do you really not know "PDFCreator"?! It has millions of active users and it is one of the most used free PDF creators! Please try the download again. Thanks.<br>
<br>
Statement from pdfforge: "What gets detected is the offer screen with optional offers which is displayed during the setup, but this isn't malware (nor is it detected as malware), as nothing is hidden and all offers can be deselected by the user. The setup file was scanned before uploading it to our servers and is safe to use."<br>
Direct download link: <a href="http://download.pdfforge.org/download/pdfcreator/PDFCreator-stable?download" class="postlink">http://download.pdfforge.org/download/p ... e?download</a></div></blockquote>
I have no idea how you are able to download this pdfforge installer.  Both Chrome &amp; firefox block it as malware.  IE will let me download it, but as soon as I try to install it, AVG blocks it as Adware BundleApp.BFY.  virustotal has a detection ratio of 7/57, with 8 "devils" and 3 "angels".  It seems conclusive that it at least has a lot of adware.  I will try disabling every security app I have and see what happens in a VM. <br>
<br>
I have found the BSOD problem and will fix it now. Thanks.</div>

My Firefox does not block the download. I checked the "safebrowsing" files of my Firefox and they are all up-to-date. Also MSE does not block the installation. It is very strange that your system blocks both actions.<br>

1. Sandboxie Control &gt; Configure &gt; Edit Configuration (Sandboxie.ini is opened in notepad.exe)<br>
2. Look for lines starting with SbieCtrl_HideMessage=<br>
3. Delete the line you wish, save changes to Sandboxe.ini and your message boxes will pop up again.</div>

Ok, when Sbie first blocks PDF Creator, a failed print job gets stuck in the PDF Creator print queue.  From then on, PDF Creator will no longer work.  After you dbl-click on SBIE1319 to allow the process to print to file, you must manually clear the print from the print queue.  Then PDF Creator will function properly.</div>

Yes, just add OpenFilePath=%Local AppData%\Temp\PDFCreator\Spool.  And everything will just work from then on.<br>
<br>
We will add some of these to templates.ini in the future, but everything is geared to getting 4.18 out ASAP because Chrome demands it.</div>

Which folder permission prevents copying a file in a sandbox folder and pasting to a different sandbox folder?<br>
Folder permissions shouldn't have change if the Sandboxie installer (4.17.7) overwrites the existing installation (4.14).<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Curt@invincea wrote:</cite>6) Fixed a rare bug in clipboard handling that could crash SbieSvc.</div></blockquote> <br>
Does this affect copying files from one sandbox folder to another?</div>
