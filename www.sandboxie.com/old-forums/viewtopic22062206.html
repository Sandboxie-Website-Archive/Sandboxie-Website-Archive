				<div class="content">In my Chrome sandbox it doesn't always end when Chrome is closed because several software_reporter_tool.exe processes are running. Is it safe to put those as lingering processes so they are killed? Does anyone else have lingering software_reporter_tool processes sometimes?<br>

				<div class="content">I don't even allow SRT exes to have run access in any of my chrome boxes. It's literally what the name implies in that it attempts to detect and aid in 'reporting' (sharing a list of) the software you have installed on the system. It's also supposedly involved in some cleanup stages of chrome as related to uninstalls but if is all kept in the sandbox anyhow there is a 99.999999999999999999999999999% chance you don't even need to let it run to start with, let alone bother worrying about <strong>if</strong> it <em>shouldn't</em> be listed as a lingering process.</div>
