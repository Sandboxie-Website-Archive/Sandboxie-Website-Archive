				<div class="content">Actually, there is an alternative. You don't need to mount/unmount reghive, and no renaming which is more efficient that is to create a shorcut to sandbox batch file, you use /hide_window to hide the command prompt. The batch file will start your program and wait for it to finish and do the task/cleaning afterward. The disadvantage is that force program is not applied.<br>
<br>
Another option which I'm not sure if will work is to run a batch file unsandboxed. The bach file will start your program with force program in set the program will be sandboxed.<br>
Wait it to finish, mount/unmount reghive then do the other tasked.<br>
<br>
Another one is to run batch file unsandboxed then the batch file will start the program in sandbox explicitly, wait it to finish, mount/unmount and etc...</div>

				<div class="content">Maybe it's because I'm drunk (my go-to excuse) but I have no idea what you just described. The delete command is working now so I'm happy but I'm still curious. Will re-read tomorrow when sober but chances are I still won't understand :P<br>
<br>
Wait so a bat in place of executing the file that does the rest later? Is that what you mean? Makes a bit of sense but why would I try that now that I have what I need via the delete command? What would be the added benefit? Another method, sure, sounds great. You certainly think outside the box!</div>

Before sandboxie invoked delete command, sandboxie does the phase 1 of delete operation that is:<br>
<br>
*Junctions (also known as reparse points) are removed.<br>
*Read-only files and directories are made fully accessible.<br>
*Files and directories that have very long names are renamed to shorter names.<br>
*Renames the sandbox to the format __Delete_(sandbox name)_(some random number)_. For example, if the sandbox is DefaultBox, it could be renamed to __Delete_DefaultBox_01C4012345678912.<br>
<br>
The time to finish these operations depend on the files and sub-folders.</div>
