				<h3>Unable to install any SandboxIE version on Windows 7</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Mon Nov 13, 2017 3:50 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I have been looking through the board for this problem, but couldn't find a topic specifically dealing with this issue, so my apologies if I have overlooked something.<br>
<br>
My problem is that I cannot install SandboxIE on my PC anymore. No version works (I have tried 5.10, 3.56, 3.58, 64-282 and 64-242).<br>
Here is what happens: When I double-click the SanboxieInstall.exe the following pop-up message appears in all versions:<br>
<br>
------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Sandboxie can only be installed on the following versions of Microsoft Windows:<br>
(64-bit)   Windows Vista (Sevice Pack 1), Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------<br>
<br>
My OS is Windows 7 Home Premium Service Pack 1, 64-bit and I have installed the latest Windows 7 Convenience Rollup, however, the problem appeared both before and after that.<br>
<br>
I'm using Comodo Internet Security but tried to install SandboxIE with it completely turned off aswell.<br>
<br>
I once used to get an additional error message when I tried to install Sandboxie (I think it was a very old version), which notified me that SanboxIE is using a driver without a signature which the system deemed to be insecure and the installation process was aborded. <br>
<br>
I believe the driver in question was located at C:\\ProgramFiles\Sandboxie\SbieDrv.sys <br>
<br>
I checked online for solutions but so far all I found were disguised Ads for third party programs, so I figured I might directly ask in the forum here.<br>
<br>
Again, if there already is a thread dealing with this problem that I have overlooked my apologies.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any help.<br>
<br>
P.S.: I used to be able to run SandboxIE on the same machine with the same OS but I cannot pinpoint the moment it stopped working – I do remember, however, that it just didn't work anymore one day without me having changed anything on the machine.</div>

<br>
Where did you get the download from? Our driver is digitally signed. <br>
<br>
It also seems that you are trying to install really old versions.  Can you please try running the current installer and see if that works?:<br>

I downloaded version 5.22 and tried to install it but got the same error message as usual.<br>
<br>
I downloaded all files from the official SanboxIE page. <br>
As I have mentioned, I got the massage about the driver signature error when I tried to install a very early version of SanboxIE which led me to believe that the driver might have been outdated. <br>
<br>
Also, I have reinstalled this early version when I newly got my current machine (which already had the same OS on it as it does now) and didn't get any error-messages back then.<br>
<br>
Just a little detail: when I open the install .exe I do get the window which allows me to choose the language, but the moment I confirm I get the error message mentioned in my last post.</div>

<br>
This is something related to your computer itself, since Sandboxie installs fine on Windows 7. <br>
Are you able to install other programs on your system? <br>
Are you using any other Security software, or have modified any policies?  <br>
Maybe you are using compatibility  mode? <br>
Can you try removing Comodo to see if that helps at all? <br>
<br>
I have found an old topic that suggests changing the DEP settings:<br>
<a href="viewtopicf6fbf6fb.html?p=64647#p64647" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?p=64647#p64647</a><br>
"To change DEP setting:<br>
1. right click MY Computer icon on your desktop and select PROPERTIES<br>
2. Click on ADAVNCED SYSTEM SETTINGS<br>
3. Go to the ADVANCED TAB&gt; PERFORMANCE&gt;SETTINGS BUTTON&gt;DATA EXECUTION PREVENTION"<br>
<br>

Yes, so far I had no issues installing any other programs on my PC except for SandboxIE - and again - I already had it installed on the machine before and it worked fine until one day it just stopped running properly. <br>
I think that was the first time I got the error message telling me something like “the program (SanboxIE) is using a driver without signature”, despite the fact that I didn't change anything in the program or on the machine.<br>
<br>
In the task bar I got the SandboxIE symbol with the red exclamation mark in it, so I uninstalled it and when I tried to reinstall it I got the error message mentioned in my first post henceforward. <br>
<br>
This happened at a time when W7 still automatically updated, and I'm suspecting it happened after an automatic update which installed when I turned off the PC for the day.<br>
<br>
I am not using any other security software than Comodo Internet Security.<br>
I have also tried in the past to install SandboxIE after having uninstalled Comodo, which didn't change anything.<br>
<br>
I am also not running on compatibility mode.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the link to the other thread. I changed the DEP settings, restarted the computer, same issue. <br>
<br>
In fact, I did all the troubleshooting I could come up with without success which led me to create this thread, because I just can't figure out what the issue is - and again - I only have it with (all) SandboxIE (versions), no other programs.</div>

<br>
Can you check your computer to see if there are leftovers from previous Sandboxie installations (old drivers, services, etc)? Check your registry as well, just in case.<br>
<br>
This post should help:<br>

				<div class="content">Hello Barb,<br>
<br>
Sorry for the delayed answer.<br>
<br>
I have located the following SandboxIE leftovers on my PC:<br>
C:\Program Files\Sanboxie\SbieDIIX.dll and deleted it.<br>
<br>
I did a complete search on my C drive for “sandboxie” and couldn't find anything. I also did a scan with Ccleaner and Revo Uninstaller, both programs didn't show me anything. <br>
Furthermore, I checked for the “sanboxie.ini” file in the Windows System folder, but it was gone aswell.<br>
As I read in the thread you linked me to it is apparently a little tricky wiping SanboxIE completely off your system, so is there anything else I should do? (Especially Registry-wise?)</div>

Not really. The uninstaller takes care of it. The only leftovers you may find (if any) could be related to context menu entries.<br>
<br>
This is definitely something related to your system setup. If you can think of any tweaks made to your OS, please let me know. <br>
<br>
Another idea:<br>
Create a new Administrator account and re-try installing.<br>
<br>
