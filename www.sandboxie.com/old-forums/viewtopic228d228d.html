				<div class="content">just figured i'd drop an update on norton 360 (22.6.0.142) compatibility.<br>
<br>
although i don't seem to have to make exceptions for individual sandboxie files anymore, norton has begun deleting the files during install.<br>
only solution is to restart when prompted, turn norton on silent mode upon boot, uninstall sandboxie, and reinstall. <br>
i've done a few restarts since, and they seem to play nice again.<br>
<br>
i changed both sonar detection and low risks to "ask me" to see if norton acts like it did previously (ie. let me install sandboxie, and then ask whether exceptions should be made or not when the processes go to run).<br>
will update again if i see any changes with the next SB beta release.</div>

not only did the install go fine, for whatever reason, norton no longer asks me to make exceptions either.<br>

Add HIPS Rules for SbieSvc.exe set to Installer or Updater<br>

You need to add ignore sandbox rules for any unrecognized applications by CIS<br>

That's ok, I don't really use AV, just installed the Firewall Component and the additional settings are required.</div>

Appreciate the code for sure. I'll give it a test also, and we'll go from there!</div>

Until they update it, Sometimes even with that disabled, we've seen some oddball behavior with Norton Antivirus / Security Suite / 365.</div>

No, and there won't be until they remove their code that interferes<br>
With Sandboxie. We will not lower our security for a antivirus program that has code from a failed sandbox attempt. We have to be aggressive into Windows and they are too. Why? Unknown, but they are the problem.<br>
<br>
Remember, Sandboxie is your primary protection, then one of the many AV products we've tested. Sandboxie Holdings / Invincea recommends Windows Defender if you're curious what's in your sandbox. Or, just make sure you delete those contents regularly.<br>
<br>
We've reached out to them in the past on what they need to do, but we're not compromising our product or our resources for an antivirus program.</div>
