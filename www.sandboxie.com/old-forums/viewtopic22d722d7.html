				<div class="content">We are receiving the error below after the patch Tuesday install of patches when trying to run Chrome or Internet Explorer in Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
The systems are running Windows 10 x64.<br>
 <br>
We tried it in an older version of Sandboxie 5.14, current 5.20, and the latest beta 5.21.4.<br>
<br>
After giving the error, the sandboxed browser closes and each attempt to start it sandboxes fails with no new errors.<br>
 <br>
How can we get this working again?<br>

<br>
Are you using AppLocker, or Group Policies perhaps? :  (see the end portion of Syrinx's response)<br>
<a href="viewtopic3790-23790.html?p=124147#p124147" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?p=124147#p124147</a><br>
<br>
Here's more information regarding SBIE2313:<br>
<a href="../SBIE2313.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/SBIE2313</a><br>
<br>
Are you using any security programs? (Antivirus, Firewall, etc..) <br>
<br>
Does the issue happen in a new Sandbox with default settings? How are you triggering the message? <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Barb,<br>
<br>
I am using GPO/Applocker/AV and a firewall.<br>
<br>
No changes to those configs in a couple months.<br>
<br>
The one change was the install of the latest Microsoft patches.<br>
<br>
This does happen with a new install and default settings.  Both with older versions of Sandboxie and the latest beta.<br>
<br>
The errors are triggered as soon as I start any app inside Sandboxie (right click on Chrome and start in Sandboxie).<br>
<br>
What can I try next?</div>

<br>
What are the security programs that you are using?  Something installed on your system (or a setting) is blocking Sandboxie from working. We need more information in order to test/review the scenario.<br>
<br>
Also, you may need to look at the thread I provided above and test if adding rules for Anonymous Logon does the trick. I think the topic covers all the details but let us know if you encounter any problems following it.<br>
<br>

<br>
It doesn't look like its related to our security software.   I created a new VM of Windows 10 Enterprise 1703 64 bit - build 15063.608 - installed all the security products and all was working fine for the last week.  <br>
<br>
Yesterday I allowed SCCM to start pushing patches to this system.<br>
<br>
Looks like all of the patches installed yesterday were Office 2016.<br>
<br>
Rebooted VM this morning, and now same problem as before - any attempt to launch a Sandboxied browser (Chrome, IE, etc) doesn't start.  Most of the time, no errors either.<br>
<br>
Any ideas how to fix this?<br>
<br>
I will attempt to uninstall the Office 2016 patches on at a time and see if that is related.<br>
<br>
Edition 	        Windows 10 Enterprise<br>

<br>
I have uninstalled the Windows patches that were recently installed, uninstalled both Symantec Endpoint and Cisco AMP, installed 5.21.7, rebooted, and I am still unable to get a Sandboxied application to start.  Same errors as before on the first attempt and then no errors, no log entries in Windows Event log.<br>
<br>
What else do you need to get this working again?</div>

<br>
Can you see if disabling your group policies (not sure if you had a chance to set them to anonymous logon?)  works for you?  <br>
From what I can find online, error 1260 is related to policies:<br>
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms681383(v=vs.85).aspx" class="postlink">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/librar ... s.85).aspx</a><br>
<br>
Regarding the rest: <br>
Please see the current issues with Norton:<br>
<a href="viewtopic4f074f07.html?f=11&amp;t=24879" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=24879</a><br>
<br>
Also, I recommend that you try the latest version of Sandboxie:<br>

<br>
It was Applocker.  <br>
<br>
To verify I disabled the AppIdSvc and Chrome in Sandboxie was able to start for a regular user with no issue.<br>
<br>
The fix:  Add a rule to Applocker executable rules that allowed 'NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON' the right to run exes.<br>
<br>
Now a regular user can run Sandboxie'd apps.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
Todd.</div>
