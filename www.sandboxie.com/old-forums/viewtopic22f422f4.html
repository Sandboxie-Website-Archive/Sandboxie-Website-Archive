Firefox 32.0.3 (outside of sandbox) has some issues with flash because browser hicks up for a while. It may be problem with s.ytimg.com scripts or two separate issues.

I am unable to reproduce it on my 32-bit computer but it happens on my 64-bit Windows 8.1 system. What could it mean if the sandbox gets deleted (normally) but then the RPC (service?) runs again (sandbox becomes active for a second) and then doesn't get delted. I know it souns weird but it's happening before my eyes.<br>

THANK YOU!</div>

Firefox and Chrome both seem to be working in this version, and so is flash in both. Granted I've only been using it for a little while and watching stupid stuff on youtube. What caused the problem with flash in earlier versions?</div>

Standalone Flash (which only seems to work in FF these days) was doing something with the security token that is similar to what Chrome does.  It did not like our fix for Chrome.  This did not affect the Flash browser add-ons.</div>

Perhaps testing previous Sandboxie betas has left garbage in your Sandboxie sandbox used by Firefox or corrupted your real Firefox profile.  Hopefully, such problems are cured by:<br>
1. deleting Sandboxie's sandbox<br>
2. deleting the parent.lock file in your Firefox profile<br>
3. creating a new Firefox profile<br>
See <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-already-running-not-responding" class="postlink">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/fi ... responding</a><br>
<br>
If you can you start Firefox unsandboxed without problems, it would provide evidence that there is a problem with the Sandboxie version you are testing.<br>
<br>
Thanks for helping to ensure that the released version of Sandboxie is stable with Firefox!</div>

I can confirm some problem that may be related to Chrome x86 in Windows 8 x64 with Sandboxie 4.13.7. I did not have a problem in Windows 7 x64 when I upgraded earlier this afternoon. Anyway it was popping up that same error message you showed in your screenshot (which I'm not quoting since it's pretty big). Here's my screenshot, the message box is owned by csrss.exe
<div class="inline-attachment">
			
		
				<dl class="file">
			<dt class="attach-image"><img src="download/filee935e935.png?id=143" class="postimage" alt="Clipboard01.png" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt>
						<dd>Clipboard01.png (8.5 KiB) Viewed 4189 times</dd>
		</dl>
		
		
		
			</div>

I also had another weird error:<br>
SBIE1241 Cannot mount registry hive:  [C0000043 / 22]<br>
SBIE2314 Canceling process chrome.exe<br>
<br>
I had to change some things around to get rid of both those errors. What I did was I went in my sandboxes and deleted the drive directory, so for example<br>
C:\Sandbox\Username\Chrome\drive<br>
because I've noticed what happens is sometimes chrome will try to update itself in the sandbox. in my case I found a chrome.exe and new_chrome.exe in the sandbox. Anyway I wiped out the whole drive part. <strong>If someone is going to try that know it wipes out everything sandboxed in the drive.</strong> You could probably just wipe out google part, like<br>
C:\Sandbox\Username\Chrome\drive\C\Program Files (x86)\Google<br>
In either case user settings for chrome are stored in the user not the drive folder.<br>
Now I have upgraded outside of sandboxie by downloading <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?system=true&amp;standalone=1" class="postlink">latest x86 chrome standalone installer for all users</a> (38.0.2125.104) and have no errors... so far...</div>

It's been few months with dropped rights issue.<br>

... well except for one small problem. When running Chrome (64-bit both in stable 38 and dev 40) i still get <strong>SBIE2318 DLL initialization failed for 'ntmarta.dll'</strong> message.<br>

As for problem with Drop Rights enabled while in Chrome. I don't experience that problem here even with Drop Rights enabled (tested with Chrome 64 stable and dev on Windows 7 x64).</div>

				<div class="content">Bellzemos, in my W7, I just tried to reproduce your issue by downloading something after allowing Direct access to the Desktop but didn't get to see the problem you are experiencing. I don't disable Services unless there is a good reason. I looked at my Services and that Service is set to start Automatically and it is currently running. Perhaps you should take a look at your Services and see how it is set. Also, you might want to test using a new sandbox with default settings to see if you still get the problem. Good luck. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>
