				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I guess it's not a one-time thing after all. It is not regular but the dots are not always in the yellow taskbar sign. There is no doubt that I am in the SB, the diamonds are there and the border appears. At the next restart everything is ok and the points are back. I am currently using the 5.23.6 beta because of the missing dots and the problem with the sound in YouTube. The sound problem is solved, but not the points. What could that have been?<br>
I use a translation program, sorry for my bad English! <br>

Please provide the required info so that we can assist you. Be sure to include repro steps:<br>

Regarding the dots in the taskbar, they appear whenever an application is running in the Sandbox. If no applications are running, then you will just see the yellow icon (sandbox). <br>

				<div class="content">Hi Barb,<br>
<br>
the desired info's are:<br>
<br>
Windows 7 SP1 x64<br>
Sandboxie 5.23.5 and 5.23.6 Beta<br>
Firefox 58.0.2<br>
Emsisoft Anti Malware <br>
<br>
All current patched<br>
<br>
The exact steps are simple. I start Firefox in the sandbox and the dots are not in the yellow box. However, it is not always the case that it is not really reproducible. It happens only occasionally. Everything else is correct. The diamonds are there, the yellow border is there and even when I open SB I am clearly in the SB. Sometimes the points are missing.</div>

<br>
Any chance your antivirus is delaying the execution of the program, causing perhaps the sanboxie icon to not update on time? <br>
<br>
Are your video drivers up-to-date ? <br>
Do any other icons in your tray present issues?<br>
<br>
Try uninstalling/re-installing Sandboxie to see if that helps.  <br>
<br>
See if you can figure out the repro steps, so that I can test them.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>

What I don't understand:

Recently, the error has also not reappeared. Perhaps my previous steps have solved the problem. That's why I waited a little while for my answer. If it should show up again, I will put a screenshot here so you can see it.</div>
