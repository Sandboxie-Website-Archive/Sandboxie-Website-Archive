				<div class="content">Would it be possible to add disable forced program in the right click menu in the image below? I don't always want ALL my forced programs disabled so I think this would be convenient.  Another annoyance is when I have to add one exe at a time when adding portable programs to start run and internet access (I always add the portable and main exe of any portable app), I would like to click the shift key and highlight all exe's at once rather than doing the same thing over a few times, it would help speed things up if your configuring alot of sandboxes.<br>

			</div>

for example, I could highlight all 3 exe's by clicking shift (adding the exe's to start run and internet access under restrictions) I hope i'm explaining it right.

				<div class="content">That's not what I am suggesting, I meant right clicking on a sandbox and have the option available to disable that particular forced program. Like if it's chrome's sandbox, just right click and choose disable then update or whatever and then re-enable. so there would need to be a option for re-enabling. And what about my other suggestion?</div>

1. The best available is Hold Ctrl+Shift while invoking the right-click Run Sandboxed command on a program that is forced, to run the program outside the supervision of Sandboxie.<br>
2. I'll pass it along to see what he Dev thinks regarding shift to select more items. <br>
<br>
...I know he is working on a gui somewhat (not a priority status) in SBIE control so you don't have to drill down so much to get to certain features, but I don't think this shift option is something they are looking at or if it will be be included. FYI We don't directly support portable apps, and they have been known to cause issues w/ the performance of SBIE. But we know some use them.<br>
<br>
The current priorities are Win10 (Updates and Redstone)<br>
Edge / Metro Apps (Win 10, 8.1)<br>
Office 2016/365<br>
Browser updates/<br>
MS security patches that break SBIE.<br>
Bug fixes.</div>
