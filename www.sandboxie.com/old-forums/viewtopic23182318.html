Additionally, it seems to strip out <em>any</em> data that isn't plain text, even when used inside a single sandbox.<br>
I just noticed this with the latest version .8 and Eclipse, which I have fully sandboxed. I can't copy classes and references to methods, and imports aren't updated either on paste. It's all plain text. <br>
(Plus, Eclipse hangs for a moment on every copy or paste operation, for about 2 sec.)</div>

My comment there was not meant to imply Sbie in W8+ was weaker. This wasn't the huge matter (of the mentioned leak), but just a glaring bug. Likely a string function passed the incorrect parameters, pinpointing the woes of hooking undocumented Windows internals which are subject to change in minor or major ways with each Windows release or Update. Subtle ways in which things change only become evident later that support for something was incomplete all along. It is a small incompatibility if anything, and good if it is. Fixing it, I maintain, will solve other unexplainable problems, existing and yet to be reported.<br>
<br>
I am suggesting incompatibilities manifest as such bugs.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Curt@invincea wrote:</cite>The real fun with Win 10 will be supporting Spartan as it is a metro app.  There are a lot of changes in the Win 10 kernel and OS, but we have a top notch reverse engineer slogging through all the assembly code.</div></blockquote>
It goes without saying that compatibility will be a slowly but gradually increasing thing, and Sbie is closing in on 100% for what it does, to the extent that it does. Expect teething problems come W10.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>bjm wrote:</cite>I follow as best I can.  SRP in theory.</div></blockquote>
SRP is an unrelated thing, I was just helping a guy out; I am not pushing SRP myself. However, since I was in a position to hot-patch the latest leak in Sandboxie, about which I am, we are, being <a href="viewtopic2ecb2ecb.php?f=17&amp;t=21113" class="postlink">purposely vague</a>, my latest InjectDll does just that but in very slapdash manner. Done with as much insight as the next person and little investigation given to what is the real reason Sandboxed programs can obtain a privileged handle to many unsandboxed processes.</div>

You mean 4.18 I'm sure. Two questions:<br>
<br>
Is the InjectDll issue discussed earlier in this thread a security vulnerability and are there any vulnerabilities that you are aware of that are not fixed in 4.18?<br>
<br>
I'm still using 4.17.5. I've been keeping a close eye on my copy and paste since some other people reported problems with it. I recently copied some text from the command console to notepad (neither sandboxed) and I noticed the text I copied had all forward slashes stripped out of it. It was really weird and I know I wasn't using sandboxie for either program (I may have switched to a sandboxed program in between the copy and the paste) but I wonder if that could in any way be related to sandboxie, specifically are you aware of something in sandboxie that strips forward slashes / out of clipboard text, like a sanitizer?<br>

The InjectDll issue has not been addressed yet.  That is next on my task list.<br>
<br>
I have resolved many of the clipboard issues, though there will probably be more.  The old clipboard code was making assumptions about the type of data being copied.  We eventually ran into a situation where this caused SbieSvc to crash (STATUS_HEAP_CORRUPTION).  It didn't happen often, but having SbieSvc crash is not good.  Unfortunately, applications can and do make their own type of clipboard data formats.  Each of these will have to be examined by us individually to determine how to handle them in SbieSvc.</div>

Thanks for the quick reply. I need the integrity of the clipboard at all costs. For example that text I copied from the command console was a private key in base64. It was missing all the forward slashes. That was really serious for me. Luckily I still had the open console. I copied again and no problem. I don't want to be an irritant but back to my question, is/was there something in sandboxie that can strip forward slashes out of text? I'd much prefer it until the clipboard issue is resolved that no copy take place or even fill it a short message saying the copy failed. What I cannot have is data that looks like the real data but isn't. This again assuming my problem has something to do with sandboxie, but I don't know. I will be sure to upgrade to 4.18 as soon as I can.<br>
<br>
