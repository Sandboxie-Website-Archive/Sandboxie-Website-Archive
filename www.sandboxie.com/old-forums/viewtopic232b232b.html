I can confirm that sbie 4.09.05 does indeed work on XP SP2 also. <br>
I just  upgraded from sbie 3.76 on XP SP2 over the top (thanks bo)<br>
and see no problems so far.<br>
<br>
When sbie 4.x was released by tzuk, he tested it for XP only with SP3. <br>
He did not have a testbed with SP2, so he gave no guarantees that it <br>
would work with XP SP2. <br>
<br>
Perhaps Invincea should test and confirm that their v4 works in XP SP2.</div>

For XP, we only support SP3.  But again, I don't know of any reason why SP 2 would not work.  Is there a reason why someone would not want to install SP 3?</div>

Curt, thanks for asking. For me, there are three reasons:<br>
<br>
1. Some of the programs I use do not work in SP3. I have tried.<br>
2. Since using sbie, I have hardly felt the need to update the OS <br>
    (from SP2) and I have had zero problems (this on our family PC). <br>
3. My own take (now that support for XP has ended) is: <br>
   ___  if it ain't broke, don't fix it. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> <br>
<br>
While you may continue to list the minimum requirements as SP3,<br>
it would be unwise to <strong>hard code</strong> sbie to work only with SP3.  My 2c <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>

Disable  Avast shields control while you are installing Sandboxie. Re-enable them when Sandboxie install is finished.</div>

Well, I've never used full screen before (pressing F11) but I just did it and the yellow border didn't appear either using 4.09.5. I don't know if this a normal behavior or not.</div>

Yeah, it's a Windows 8 thing, other apps in the past have had theming issues (nothing to do with Sandboxie), Some still do, like Google Music Manager.</div>
