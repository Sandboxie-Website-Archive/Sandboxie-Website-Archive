Google Chrome latest version<br>
Sanboxie 4.07.04<br>
<br>
Having version 4.07.03 prior to this new one, just after installing this new one and attempted to run Google Chrome then a BSOD, rebooted and SBIE Control was not working properly. Uninstalled it, then installed again, tried to run Google Chrome an a BSOD once more.<br>
<br>
Here is a link with a zip file containing minidump, ntoskrnl.exe and a screenshot files.<br>

<strong>FYI I can't use Sandboxie anymore, only BSODs as result of updating.</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Thank you, and I apologize!  Should have tested better on 32-bit Windows 8.1.  I am pretty sure I tested on that system at one point, but I guess that was before final changes.<br>
<br>
Version 4.07.04a for 32-bit should fix this:<br>

No problem. I wouldn't want to be in your shoes, you have a LOT of work with all requests and problems from other users. I perfectly understand what's going on and BTW I wonder, due to Sandboxie is tzuk, what's going to happen with your Sanboxie program if something happens to you, no offense. Hopefully you've already made provisions for this. I mean Sandboxie is a such a great and important legacy to the world of computers, hence it should be continued by someone else, again, no offense please.</div>
