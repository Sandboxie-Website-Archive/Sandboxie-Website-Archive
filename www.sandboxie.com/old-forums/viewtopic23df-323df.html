				<h3>Multiple Error Popups Every Time Sandbox Deleted</h3>

<br>
I have been having an issue with the current and previous version of Sandboxie that I did not experience prior. Every time I terminate a sandbox and delete it's contents, I get multiple popup error notifications for each Sandbox. Here is a screenshot of the errors happening on 1 sandbox: <a href="http://imgur.com/SiTCO1H" class="postlink">http://imgur.com/SiTCO1H</a><br>
<br>
This happens every single time I terminate a sandbox. Most of the time I'm running multiple sandboxes at once, and terminating them at once, which creates a dozen or more total popups that begin showing about 5-10 seconds after terminating. Here is some of my setup info if it helps anything:<br>
<br>
- Windows 10 64 Bit<br>
- Happens on both 5.18 and 5.20<br>
- Installed to C:/program files/sandboxie<br>
- Main sandbox is located at C:/sandbox<br>
- Delete invocation is set (auto delete upon termination)<br>
<br>
This has been happening for quite some time now. During this period of time my PC has gone through a couple of formats, so I know it's happening on a clean Windows install as well. I'm wondering if there is any fix for this, if others are experiencing it, and/or if it is something that can be fixed in a future version. It's really annoying because it forces these Windows on top and it also plays a 'ding' sound for each one that pops up, though I know the sound is Windows related. Thanks for any help.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello mloveless1227,<br>
<br>
We are not seeing other reports of this behavior<br>
<br>
Are you running any specific programs when the issue is triggered? <br>
Do you have any antivirus software installed? <br>
What else is open when the issue occurs?<br>
Does it occur in a new Sandbox with default settings?<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>

				<div class="content">Happens to anything I sandbox. No anti virus. Doesn't matter what else is open, that has no bearing on what the sandbox is deleting, but for the sake of it I'll say it happens whether I have other stuff running or if I attempt to recreate the issue on a fresh Windows boot. Occurs in any sandbox with any settings including default.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi mloveless1227,<br>
<br>
If you manually delete the contents of the Sandbox, does the issue re-appear? <br>
<br>
Without other users reports, and being unable to reproduce the issue, I will need more information from you to see what may be going on. <br>
If you could please provide repro steps including the exact setup that you are using and programs involved (including any windows policies that may be setup (if any)), I will test it. If you are using web-browsers, let me know which ones and if there are any toolbars/extensions added. <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>

				<div class="content">You can try to use the SDelete command instead of RMDIR and see if the errors remain.<br>
<br>
On the other hand the error message you have provided, says :"The system cannot find the file specified"<br>
<br>
It seems that the RMDIR command is unable to find the file to delete. I do not know for sure but It may have something to do with the 8dot3 naming in windows 10. I believe the 8dot3 file naming is not enabled by default in windows 10. You can query the setting in a cmd window (with admin rights) and the command: <strong>fsutil behavior query disable8dot3 c:</strong><br>
when I execute this command, I get:<br>
<br>
The volume state is: 0 (8dot3 name creation is enabled).<br>
The registry state is: 2 (Per volume setting - the default).<br>
<br>
Based on the above two settings, 8dot3 name creation is enabled on c:<br>
<br>
If it turn out that 8dot3 is disabled, you can try to enable 8dot3 and see if this fixes your error.<br>
Please read up on the subject. I do not know for sure If this is the issue. Please backup your system before making any changes.</div>
