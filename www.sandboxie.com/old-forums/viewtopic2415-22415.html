				<h3>Sandboxie Not Deleting</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
My problem started with v5.24 then overwritten with v5.22 and then v5.20 and all do the following:<br>
Upon close of IE 11, v11.0.9600.18860, the red X appears, but remains static. If I manually choose to delete the Sandbox, SB shows the number of folders and files accumulated and if I click Delete, it goes through the motions, BUT NOTHING IN THE SANDBOX IS DELETED.  If I then choose Delete again, SB says that the SB is empty.  If I open SB to look at the folders and files, whichever folder I'm in will start to delete the contents, ONE ITEM AT A TIME, and it takes a VERY long time to complete.<br>
I am running Win 7, 64-Bit and I have ESET v11.1.42.0 and MBAM v3.4.4 and Win Defender is current.<br>
I have NOT installed KB4074598 or KB2952664.<br>
I have not tried to duplicate the issue with FF or Chrome, as IE is my browser of choice.<br>
Please advise.<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>

				<div class="content">Hello Again,<br>
Okay, I did some more testing today, still running SB v5.20 (my old favorite) and here are the results:<br>
Upon closing Outlook 2007, SB deleted the files and the red X cleared.<br>
Upon closing Thunderbird v52.6.0.6597, SB deleted the files and the red X cleared.<br>
Upon closing Firefox v59.0.1.6648, SB deleted the files and the red X cleared.<br>
Was unable to run Chrome v65.0.3325.181 Sandboxed; tried several times.<br>
Upon closing IE 11, SB DELETED THE FILES AND THE RED X WAS CLEARED!!!  I have no idea why.<br>
<br>
If anyone has any explanation, I would welcome it.<br>
<br>
Also, I wonder why SB has been well over 8,000 KB since v5 was introduced, yet v5.24 is only 5,506 KB?<br>
<br>
And, if v5.20 works for my system vs. v5.22 and v5.24, am I safe?<br>
<br>
I want to add that SB has been slower and slower to delete the Sandbox with each revision.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any input.<br>

Just closed IE 11, waited 15 minutes for SB to delete the SB, but not even the red X appeared.  I then went to manually delete the contents, and received the following Error Msg.: "Some sandboxed programs could not be stopped. The contents of the sandbox will not be deleted."<br>
<br>
There were NO programs open. None.<br>
<br>
I am at a loss.</div>

<br>
Please have a look at these:<br>
<a href="../ProgramStopSettings.html#leader" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/ProgramStopSettings#leader</a><br>
<a href="viewtopicc764c764.html?p=133075#p133075" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?p=133075#p133075</a><br>
<br>
Regarding being safe, we always recommend using the latest versions of Sandboxie to ensure compatibility. <br>
As for size, Sandboxie 5.24 uses VS2015,  which has changed file sizing for some portions of it.  <br>
