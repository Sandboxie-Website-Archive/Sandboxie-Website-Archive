				<div class="content">I have an update to the DLL that also hooks CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(), however I'd like some opinions before I finalize it.<br>
<br>
For those not familiar with it, this function takes system snapshots of several kinds, and the information in the snapshot is determined by a set of flags:<br>
<br>
- system-wide process and thread enumeration<br>
- process specific module and heap enumeration<br>
<br>
My current hook strips any system-wide snapshot flags, preventing process and thread enumeration.  Then it looks at what is left in the flags parameter.  If there are any process specific flags, it determines if the process is running sandboxed or not, and then allows or blocks the call.<br>
<br>
What do you think about the blanket system-wide enumeration blocks?  Is that going too far, or is it a good security measure?  I want it to be secure, but not break functionality.  Some possible changes:<br>
<br>
- allow process enumeration, but not thread enumeration<br>
- vice-versa<br>
- allow both<br>
<br>
Thoughts?</div>

				<h3>Updated Test Version</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Fri Feb 13, 2009 4:24 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>wraithdu</strong></div>
				<div class="content">If I could get some people to test this new version it would be very helpful!  Instead of listing what's changed, I'm going to list what it does, since a lot has changed.  The basic idea is the same, it blocks access from sandboxed processes to unsandboxed processes.<br>
<br>
Functions hooked:<br>
- NtOpenProcess<br>
- NtQuerySystemInformation<br>
- NtReadVirtualMemory<br>
- CreateToolhelp32Snapshot<br>
<br>
Behavior:<br>
- blocks system-wide enumeration of running processes and threads (includes Toolhelp32 and PSAPI functions)<br>
- blocks access to unsandboxed processes - cannot open processes, or read their memory<br>
<br>
I want to be sure that I'm not going too far and breaking applications.  I'm currently running the DLL, and so far I haven't had any problems, but a wider testbed would be nice.  As before, a plethora of debug information can be seen by running Dbgview from Sysinternals.  Once tested, I will release two versions with and without debug output to reduce size and increase performance (I'm sure only a very tiny bit).<br>
<br>
The included 'injtest.exe' program has also changed.  Now you have to provide a PID to it on the commandline.  The easiest way is to open a sandboxed command prompt, navigate to 'injtest.exe', and type 'injtest.exe 1234' where 1234 is the PID of some sandboxed or unsandboxed process.<br>

				<div class="content">Hi, and thanks for this neat addon.<br>
<br>
A question - seems like when I'm running andboxie with your injected dll, the process blocking features work, but I can't run a sandboxed instance of Windows Explorer anymore. I get the errors "SBIE2313 Could Not Execute SandboxieRpcSs.exe" and "SBIE2204 Cannot Start Sandboxed Service RpcSs", and windows explorer does not start. Without injecting the dll they work fine.<br>
<br>
I'm wondering, is it supposed to be this way (a limitation) or is that just a bug (oversight). And what (if anything) can I do about it.<br>
<br>
Once again, thanks for all your efforts, I'm sure they're appreciated by many people.</div>

<br>
Which version of the DLL are you using, the one from the first post, or the test version?  What OS are you using, any other security software?  Could you run the debug version along with Dbgview and post the output?</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I'm running <strong>Sandboxie 3.34</strong> on <strong>Windows XP (Media Center Edition, Service Pack 2)</strong>.<br>
<br>
I tested with <strong>(both) the new dll and old dll</strong> versions. <strong>Both encounter the same issue.</strong><br>
<br>
I'm positive the injection works because I can run single, isolated applications successfully. The process memory restriction works perfectly. (I did a test, ran taskmanager sandboxed, then ran one sandboxed "calculator" app and one unsandboxed one. Only the sandboxed one was detected , which is correct). Therefore, the only problem is starting the Windows Explorer.<br>
<br>
As nick s mentioned, the sandboxed explorer process does appear in the sandboxed process list, but the window does not show or function (probably due to the fact that SandboxieRpcSs.exe and SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe fail to load).</div>

Ok, couple things here:<br>
<br>
1) From your debug output, you're running the released version of the DLL from the first post, not the test version.  The test version would show additional hooks on NtOpenProcess, NtQuerySystemInformation, and CreateToolhelp32Snapshot.<br>
2)  This means that explorer in XP can't even handle the one hook on NtReadVirtualMemory, lame.<br>
<br>
Try a new build of the test version from this post<br>
<br>
<a href="../phpbb/viewtopic1264.php?p=33013#33013" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/phpbb/viewtopi ... 3013#33013</a><br>
<br>
In this version, I've placed an exclusion for explorer.exe on OS's below Vista / Server 2008, so the DLL won't be injected.  Try it out and see if explorer works.  Test on some other software also, just to see if XP is less tolerant of these kinds of restrictions versus Vista.  Make sure to test software that also causes SandboxieRpcSs and SandboxieDcomLaunch to run.  It could be a conflict with the Sandboxie processes on XP, and not explicitly with explorer.exe.  If this is the case, I can make exclusions for the Sandboxie processes.  Thanks!</div>

okay, i've tested out the version you've pointed me to. This time, the SandboxieRpcSs.exe process runs (last time it didnt, now it does), but I still get the error saying "Could not execute SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe" and "Cannot start sandboxed service DcomLaunch". <br>
<br>
Overall it is still not functioning, though now I can see two processes in the sandboxie window (explorer.exe and SandboxieRpcSs.exe) compared to only explorer.exe last time.<br>
<br>
<strong>This is the new debug output that I get when trying to open a sandboxed explorer with the new dll you directed me to.</strong><br>

				<div class="content">Ok, try the test version again, v1.0.0.2.  This time I've excluded all Sandboxie processes, but not explorer.  Hopefully the problem here is with the SB procs, at least it is judging by the errors you've mentioned.  Thanks again for testing.<br>
<br>
Out of curiosity, before you try the new version, see these lines?
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>[8988] IsPIDSandboxed<br>

What process is PID 9108?  You'll have to run the test again and look in TaskManager, as your PIDs will change and this number will probably be different.  This is referring to SandboxieRpcSs.exe trying to read the memory of some unsandboxed process and being blocked.</div>
