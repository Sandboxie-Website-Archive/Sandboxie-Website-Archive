				<div class="content">Just wanted to let you know if you run this little nifty program (outside of sandboxie) <a href="http://www.brianapps.net/sizer/" class="postlink">http://www.brianapps.net/sizer/</a> it will crash anything that is sandboxed... probably some hooking conflict going on with the window, maybe you care, maybe you don't. Would be cool if this could get fixed sometime in the future though so I don't have to worry about running the two together anymore.</div>

<br>
I am setting up an environment to test Sizer 3.34 on a 32 bit machine. I'll post an update as soon as I can. <br>
UPDATE: I installed 3.34 on a Win 10 FCU x86 VM + SBIE 5.21.7 . The only thing I managed to change resolution for was the icon area, next to the date/time.  Can you please provide repro steps? According to the website, support ended in 2012 for Sizer 3.34 <br>
<br>
I tested Sizer 4.0 on a x64 machine. I did not experience any crashes.I used ctrl+Win+Z and resized a browser window to different resolutions. <br>
Are using x86 or x64 OS / program ?<br>
<br>
In case you are using x64 OS, please review this entry (from their page):<br>
<a href="http://www.brianapps.net/sizer4/" class="postlink">http://www.brianapps.net/sizer4/</a><br>
<br>
"New Version<br>
This page gives details about Sizer 3.34, which was designed to run on 32 bit systems only and was last updated in 2012. Attempts to port this version a modern 64 bit OS proved difficult so a ground-version has been created. Previews of the new version (Sizer 4.0)    are now available. If you experience incompatiblities or problems with Sizer 3.34 then you should try Sizer 4.0 instead."<br>

				<div class="content">First off, thanks for looking into this. I'm on Windows-x64 if that matter but I don't think it does because Sizer works flawless on anything that is not Sandboxed (ie. anything with a yellow box around it). I'm also aware of version 4.0, but it's premature with gutted features and not as good, 4.0's main draw is that it's able to interact with metro apps. <br>
<br>
Anyway here are my settings for Sizer 3.34 maybe it's needed to reproduce.<br>
<br>

<br>
All I do is have Sizer run in the system tray, and if I touch any window that is Sandboxed with my cursor, I'm greeted with this crash message.<br>
<br>

<br>
I wonder if it has anything to do with this feature of Sizer? <a href="../i.imgur.com/Dxe0CoK.png" class="postlink">https://i.imgur.com/Dxe0CoK.png</a></div>

<br>
The website states that for Windows 10 x64, you need to use Sizer v4.0 as the other one is for 32 bits only and hasn't been updated in 5 years. I don't know what are the things that don't work under 10x64 with Sizer 3.34, but if it is not compatible with the OS, chances are Sandboxie will not play well with it. <br>
<br>
Please give the new version a try and let us know if you are still experiencing issues. <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
