				<div class="content">I saw something odd while I was still under moderation on this new account, an entirely new [ok so it was old] area (archives) with the ancient/closed threads. Now that I can once again post without moderation {knock on wood} these areas are now inaccessible [they don't even get displayed]. Using google, even while logged in here and happening upon one of those threads results in it being unavailable. :-/ Seems like an oversight of permissions somewhere, I'm <em>assuming</em> we should be able to see them while un-moderated (eg posts don't need Craigs stamp of approval anymore [ok so more like it's not <strong>irrelevant</strong>  spam..but I know you wanted to click that delete button when reading my drunken posts :P /bug /bug]) or that the moderated (new users) shouldn't be able to see these older threads either.</div>
