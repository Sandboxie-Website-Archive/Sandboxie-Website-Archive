				<h3>Prevent application from running browser to access internet</h3>

				<div class="content">Hey,<br>
<br>
I do occasionally find myself in the annoying situation where a program is (without my consent) opening a web address via my browser. <br>
Now, it <em>does</em> open the browser inside its own sandbox, which is ok, but I'd rather not have it have access to the browser (and by extension the internet via <em>it</em>) at all.<br>
Especially since the browser will be in its default config, since all plugins and settings and such are in the browser's own sandbox.<br>
<br>
Under Start/Run Access you can define which applications are allowed to run inside the sandbox, but I'd like to request the <em>opposite</em> of that, a blacklist, so I can specifically set my browser and email program to never ever be run inside any given sandbox except its own.</div>

				<div class="content">You can force a specific browser to run in a specific sandbox. Go to the Sandbox settings for that Sandbox, then Applications, then the application/browser. The first option is "Force [browser] to run in this sandbox".<br>
<br>
Also, you can set a program to not access the internet. In Restrictions, Internet Access, add the program you don't want accessing the internet.<br>
<br>
It sounds like one of these should resolve what you're seeing.<br>

Jim, neither of these things work. The browser is fully installed in its own sandbox and gets called via regular system browser association. So a sandboxed instance is started, <em>inside</em> of the sandbox the program uses, that called it, which I don't want. (Since the browser won't have any of its settings, addons and other security measures.)<br>
I also don't want to deny this program entirely internet access, since it uses that to send crash reports. (And I can control that via firewall.)</div>

Go to "Sandbox Settings" of the sandbox you want to configure. Then open "Resource Access -&gt; File Access -&gt; Blocked Access".<br>
<br>
Click in "Add Program" and select the browser(s) you want to block.<br>
<br>
Let us know if that fits your needs.</div>

Alright, that seems to work. It fails now with "Application not found". <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
Now how do I instigate that policy in all sandboxes (except the browser's) by default...</div>

Repeat the operation for all sandboxes you want.<br>
<br>
You could apply the policy to all sandboxes but I doubt you can do it for "all except".</div>
