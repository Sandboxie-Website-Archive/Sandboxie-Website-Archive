				<div class="content">I want to block the whole D:\ except a very detailed folder such as D:\a\b\c... It is very difficult for me to add every folder in D: in Sandboxie, because it is too many folders and files. So is there a way to add it simply such as write a regular expression in the Sandboxie setting? Thank you.</div>

				<div class="content">Generically speaking, no. While it is possible to isolate areas and only allow 'certain' things to see or interact with them - there is nothing atm, to my knowledge, which works exactly as you desire. I could easily use that scenario myself but sadly it is not how things are in the cards, atm. The workarounds I tend to use are GLOBAL [ClosedFilePath(s)] with an [!]exception for whatever program.exe or &lt;ProcessGroup&gt; actually needs access followed by any other relevant rules that may help lock that particular box down inside its own.<br>
Sort of a deny everything except this and this extra rules for related boxes which might require many other rules of their own.<br>
<br>
ugh so confusing!?</div>
