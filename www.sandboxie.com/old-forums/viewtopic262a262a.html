				<h3>Pin This PC to TaskBar</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
Windows 10<br>
<br>
Does anyone know how to pin This PC to TaskBar.<br>
<br>
A simple operation, however, i will explain as follows:<br>
<br>
I have two pc's and both running Windows 10<br>
<br>
On first pc:<br>
I somehow managed to get This PC in the start menu and then I proceed to right click the This PC from the start menu to pin to TaskBar and did so without any issues, since there was a 'pin to taskbar' available. Thus now that I have pinned this to the taskbar and on viewing the icon in taskbar it is the same icon as that of what the image in start menu looks like, a blue desktop window computer.<br>
<br>
In any case, when clicking on the blue icon on taskbar, a yellow folder opens which is the 'This PC' and however opens at the far right end of my taskbar icons. Thus i can press the blue icon repeatedly and another folder 'This PC' opens in the same place as the first yellow one opened. Which is all fine and the way i want it, however the following is strange:<br>
<br>
Second pc:<br>
1) I open This PC and right click on the left side in the list named This PC and i select pin to start.<br>
2) I then proceed to right click the blue icon This PC from the start menu so as to pin to TaskBar as i did with the first pc, however there is no pin to taskbar.<br>
<br>
I appreciate some help on this, as I am banging my head trying to recreate this on the second PC, I can't remember how I did it the first time, as explained above of the first PC.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi bjm,<br>
<br>
The first pc has been updated with creators update and so has the second pc, however my first pc is still able to achieve this.<br>
<br>
Your answer may have merit, because what springs to my mind is maybe the fact that i had this in place before the creator update, that it may have now stuck with it. However this is a maybe.<br>
<br>
I would be very surprised if there is no way of achieving such even with the updated creator.<br>
<br>
If maybe this issue can't be dealt with here, maybe a suggestion to whom i can ask this question to get a fix.</div>
