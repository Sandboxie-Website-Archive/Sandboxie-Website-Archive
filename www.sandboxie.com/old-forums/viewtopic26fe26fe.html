				<div class="content">In Sandbox settings, you can set programs that run in the sandbox to recover files to specific folders, bypassing sandboxing/with no dialogue.<br>
<br>
Check Sandbox settings&gt;Resource access&gt;Direct access&gt;File access, and try applying to what you want to do.<br>

				<div class="content">You can used the Edit/Add button to enter your exclusion. The "<strong>*</strong>" is a wild card that matches any file name, and the ".jpg" limits the exclusion to files with that extension.<br>
Personally, I like to first use the "Add Program" button to enter the .exe name of the program that's taking the screenshot, to limit the setting to just that one program.<br>
If it was a browser add-on that's taking the screenshot, then the browser's .exe name would probably be the one to use.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for your reply but I don't understand how it would help to me. May be I don't provide some details of my situation. So:<br>
<br>
1. I installed program into sandboxie. There is no unsandboxed copy of installed programm, only in sandboxie.<br>
2. I need run this program at sandboxie because I am not sure about this software, I don't trust this programm.<br>
3. I need recover *.jpg files that created this program without recover dialog. Just move files *.jpg from sandboxie folder to HDD relevant folder.<br>
<br>
Any idea?!</div>

Since the program is installed in the sandbox, then you need to give the program Full access instead of File access.<br>
<br>
At this time, I have Irfanview installed in a sandbox. If I wanted jpgs to go straight though to my desktop after modifying them in the sandbox, this is how my Full access window in the Irfanview sandbox would look like. You need to do something similar.<br>
