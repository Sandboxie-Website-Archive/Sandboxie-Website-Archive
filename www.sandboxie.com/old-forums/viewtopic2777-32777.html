				<div class="content">Hi Tzuk,<br>
Instead of selecting the recovery option for each individual sandbox, the general recovery window could display all files elligible for recovery in all sandboxes. That way for people who multitask and download several things in multiple sandboxes wouldn't have to go hunting for it, everything in the virtual environment could be easily seen and recovered from one window.<br>
<br>
For ease of access, you could include the Recovery option with the "Terminate All Programs" and "Disable Forced Programs" settings instead for the tray icon menu. This would then replace the individual recovery options for each sandbox. (Maybe this space could be used for a 'Sandbox Settings' option reached from the tray icon menu for individual sandboxes?)<br>
<br>
Similar to what it is now, with the collapsible folder hierarchy, you could apply it one level higer to sandboxes in the recovery window. This makes it easily navigable as is the case now with the SBIE control.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not sure this is a general use case that would require this addition.  The Files and Folders View is designed to display one sandbox at a time, and having just reworked it recently, I'm not sure I want to go back and re-do it again.  But it's a nice suggestion, and we can leave it around for future reconsideration.</div>
