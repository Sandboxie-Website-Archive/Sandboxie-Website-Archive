I suggest a white background to improve legibility and appearance.</div>

				<div class="content">Is it really that much of a bother? It's just a light background in Sandboxie Control, which most people don't look at very often anyways, light enough that it blends in and you don't even notice it after using Sandboxie for a little while. I mean, unless it is interfering with the program's operation, then just ignore it.<br>
Anyways, tzuk has already stated in other threads that he wishes to keep it there as it offers "branding" and he doesn't want to remove it or introduce options to do so.</div>

I use a screen resolution of 1920x1200 and I have the habit to resize windows to take advantage of my monitor.<br>
In my opinion sandboxie is not currently optimized to work for this resolution. Particularly with the latest release, I always have to strain my eyes to read all text inside background:<br>
