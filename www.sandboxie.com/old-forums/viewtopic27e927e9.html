Only slightly odd thing I've noticed is the "Automatically delete contents" setting now takes longer to invoke when closing the browser for example. Previously it would clear in about 2-3 seconds of closing. After version .12 installed I've seen it take as long as 30+ seconds. Not always, but it did not do this with the previous versions. Nothing serious but I thought I would mention.</div></blockquote>
I think it's a coincidence probably some background applications  or scheduled maintenance that contributed to disk activity. Sandboxie uses "rmdir" which is a MS-DOS command to delete these contents and will invoke when there is no running program in the sandbox. So, basically sandboxie is not causing that delay.</div>

How are you installing this Program? In the sandbox? If so, install the program on your host and run as sandboxed. <br>

This program has not been tested with SBIE.<br>

Do you have any antivirus or antimalware installed?</div></blockquote>

I installed it in the sandboxie, I can use LINE messenger to login before 4.5.0.873.<br>
Unfortunately they force users to use latest version.<br>
I use Avast 2016.<br>
I don't want to install in host. Could you help to debug?</div>

Line is a trust worthy program from what I can tell. Your best to install it on your host, and run as sandboxed. Most types of theses clients require they be installed and have access to resources that SBIE most likely blocks.</div>

Actually I'm running LINE in a sandbox without problem and just recently updated into 4.7.0.1027 about two or three days ago if I remember it correctly. And I just updated my sandboxie installation from 5.11.7 (beta) into 5.12 stable in less than 30 minutes ago and it's still works just fine which means that I've been using LINE 4.7 that is installed in a sandbox since I'm on 5.11.7.<br>
<br>
Also just to make sure, I redownloaded the line installer again and installed it again into a sandbox just now, and it still works fine here. I'm on Win7 x64 in case you're running on other windows version.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the feedback. It's been a while since we tested LINE. I know in the past it worked, then didn't. So It's good to know.</div>
