Try a new Sandbox, or deleting the contents of your current one and see if that alleviates the issue. <br>
Otherwise, please update the thread I provided with more info so we can investigate.<br>

I downloaded files using the latest stable version of Firefox x64 and noticed a delay as well. <br>
It does not seem happen with other apps/ browsers (including Firefox x86). Can you confirm? <br>
<br>
For example, copy a file to your Downloads folder (Sandboxed) and see if you are prompted with Quick Recovery.<br>

I am able to launch Chrome 64 on Windows 15603 and navigate random websites, how are you reproducing the problem? <br>
What are your OS and SBIE versions? What is your Chrome version? <br>
Do you have an Antivirus installed? <br>
Does the issue happen in a new Sandbox? <br>
Is Chrome installed inside Sandboxie?<br>

I have my browser sandbox set to delete all content once everything has exited. I do not have chrome installed inside of Sandboxie itself. Currently when I run ProcessMon I cannot get the OpenProcess error to appear, might be because it had already appeared a bit earlier. What kind of filters should I have setup for ProccessMon to capture the required information?</div>

				<h3>MS Office 2016: Programs not terminated after closing</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sat Apr 08, 2017 4:12 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Inbox</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
after doing a clean install of the latest version of Windows 10 (Creators Update v1607) and Sandboxie (v5.17.6), I installed Microsoft Office 2016 VL Edition (with latest updates from April 2017) normally.<br>
I force all MS Office apps to get started in a Sandbox, which is working fine.<br>
<br>
But I'm facing a bug: After closing MS Office apps (doesn't matter if it's Outlook, Word or Excel), the programs are running further in Sandboxie. They don't get terminated.<br>
I'm not able to restart the programs, until I force kill them via Sandboxie Manager.<br>
<br>
Is this a known bug and does someone have a workaround for this?<br>
<br>
Thanks.</div>

				<h3>Upgraded to Windows 10, now SB won't work?</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Mon Apr 10, 2017 4:07 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Ander</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Hi guys,<br>
<br>
I've just upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10—and suddenly Sandboxie doesn't work. When I try to run a sandboxed app, or even open its start menu (R-click SB system-tray icon; point to sandbox; "Run from Start Menu"), I get this error:<br>
<br>
<span style="color: green">SBIE1222 Error with security token:  [C00000BB / 35]<br>
SBIE1222 Error with security token:  [C00000BB / 36]<br>
SBIE2314 Canceling process Start.exe<br>
</span><br>
I'm running the latest SB version (5.16). I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling SB (with reboot between), but no luck.<br>
<br>
The only references I can find to error 1222 say that the problem causing it was fixed in a new SB release years ago. Have any idea why it's still happening to me? Thanks!</div>

Have you started Chrome outside Sandboxie since the update? If not, please do, make sure it is fully up-to-date and relaunch it once more before launching it inside Sandboxie. <br>
<br>
If the issue continues to happen, please respond in the other thread (I previously posted a link), so that everything is tracked in one place. <br>
You should add "process contains --&gt; Chrome"  to your procmon. <br>

We were able to reproduce the issue with FF x64 + Windows FR latest update.<br>
The devs are aware.<br>
You can use Firefox 32 bits as a workaround for the time being. We'll post an update once new info becomes available.<br>
------------------------------------ X ------------------------------------<br>
Pelone,<br>
<br>
I am unable to reproduce the issue with Chrome. Does the problem happen in a new Sandbox? <br>
Can you delete Chrome's cache and re-try? <br>
How are you reproducing the issue, exactly? (Are you downloading anything specific?) <br>
------------------------------------ X ------------------------------------<br>
Inbox,<br>
UPDATE:<br>
I can repro the problem , I'll make the devs aware. <br>
<br>
Does the problem follow you to a new Sandbox? <br>
Do you have any addons installed in Office?<br>

I am trying to reproduce the issue, I think I found something similar (it doesn't seem to happen with every download, but I am noticing a delay downloading a specific file). <br>
Still looking into it, but it would be great if you could provide more info regarding what are you downloading.<br>
<br>
Can you also let me know if the Quick Recovery option pops up if you switch tabs after the download is finished? <br>
<br>
