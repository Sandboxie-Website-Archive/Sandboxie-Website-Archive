				<div class="content">Maybe it's there, but you need to use the "Run From Start Menu" for that sandbox.<br>
If the program added a sandboxed shortcut to the Desktop or the Start Menu when you installed it, then you should be able to find that shortcut using the "Run From Start Menu" option for the sandbox.<br>
<br>
Either right-click the Sandboxie Control tray icon and hover the mouse above the sandbox name, or right-click the sandbox in Sandboxie Control's window, to find that Menu.<br>
<br>
If the program did not add a sandboxed Desktop or Start Menu shortcut when it was installed in the sandbox, you need to create a shortcut to its .exe program in the sandbox.</div>

I'll try the "Run Form StartMenu" and see if that works. I already tried creating a shortcut and it didn't work. Be back.</div>

<br>
Check the Setting&gt;Delete&gt;Delete invocation, be sure that you've not ticked "Automatic delete"...but instead tick "Never remove this sandbox or delete its contents" if you want that program to be permanent in that sandbox.</div>
