<br>
Yeah I'm doing that as we speak. Although, the list of apps you requested won't be useful since not only does it not complete (It has maybe 30% of what I have installed) but also it literally has maybe 35 things on that list and 20 of them are "Microsoft Office ..." So I'll do the procmon</div>

Make sure your Sandbox contents have been deleted. Then try again, if issue persists, then follow the steps to send us a ProcMon report as we're not able to recreate the issue. <br>
Antivirus?<br>
Any errors?<br>
<br>
You can use procmon and post the results to us. To this email. <br>
<br>
Get procmon here (free) <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx" class="postlink">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sys ... 96645.aspx</a><br>
<br>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Step #1</span></strong><br>
Close any programs that are not needed.<br>
Run Procom (not sandboxed)<br>
and then try and fire up FireFox (or the browser causing issues) (sandboxed of course). <br>
Let the error happen/not load/etc <br>
stop capturing events in Procmon (under file) <br>
then Save the results (under file, make sure "save all events it ticked") and <br>
save in PML format. <br>
These files can be large, so post somewhere we can download and look (link)<br>
OR (Please zip them!) and send to <a href="mailto:Support@sandboxie.com">Support@sandboxie.com</a><br>
<br>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Step #2:</span></strong> Also, if you can give us a snapshot of your installed software by opening Power Shell (as admin) and type:<br>
<br>
<strong>Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product | Select-Object -Property Name &gt; C:\Software\PCapps.txt</strong> <br>
<br>
The<strong> PCapps.txt </strong>will be created listing your software, file you can send to us as well as the PML</div>

				<div class="content">Firefox still does not work. Other variations of firefox (Like Palemoon do work though. So it's something specific with Firefox). Also how do I fix my second issue which I posted about? Eraser command:<br>
<br>
"C:\Program Files\Eraser\Eraser.exe" erase /quiet /method=bf8ba267-231a-4085-9bf9-204de65a6641 dir="%SANDBOX%"<br>
<br>
will not work. It says "The requested operation requires elevation  (740)". I can fix this by running Sandboxie control as admin manually but with it auto starting with windows, it won't execute the command.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Curt@invincea wrote:</cite>Have you tried setting eraser to always run as admin?</div></blockquote>

Yes. Eraser is always set to run as admin, it also starts with windows.<br>
<br>
Sandboxie on the other hand, although the service starts with windows, the "Sandboxie control" doesn't (ie: It's not in the notification area). Now if I open up a program sandboxied, it opens but when I go to delete the contents of the sandbox it gives me the "Requires elevation permissions" error. (Keep in mind, I have sandboxie checked to start with windows and it's supposed to start in administrator mode)<br>
<br>
The only way the problem goes away is if I:<br>
<br>
a) manually open sandboxie control as admin mode (Right click &gt; Open as administrator)<br>
<br>
b) Close the sandboxie control that opens indirectly when opening a sandboxed browser and I manually open as in option (a)<br>
<br>
So I guess that's two problems.<br>
<br>
1) Sandboxie control doesn't start with windows (I've tried, unchecking and rechecking the "start with windows" option in the shell integration menu)<br>
<br>
2) When Sandboxie control is started indirectly (Via opening a sandboxied program/or browser in my case) it doesn't start as administrator.</div>

Well, you're running as a elevated user then. So it's a totally different process.<br>
 <br>
When we see this issue, I'd usually say...clean out your sb first. Disable any add ons / extensions.<br>
<br>
Are you running A/V ....antimalware?<br>
<br>
I'd also urge you to try the Beta v5.07 version.</div>
