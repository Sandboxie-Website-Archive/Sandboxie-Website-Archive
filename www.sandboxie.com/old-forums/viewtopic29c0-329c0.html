I have no idea what that process is - it's strange... the ID that appears in the debug view doesn't seem to exist in either sandboxie or task manager. (I tried a few times, each time the ID doesn't exist)<br>
<br>
regarding the latest version, <strong>explorer does run now,</strong> but it starts up with an error "<em>The procedure entry point RegGetValueW could not be located in the dynamic link library ADVAPI32.dll</em>". Both SandboxieRpcSs.exe and SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe are running, and the explorer window is visible and functioning<br>
<br>
That would still be fine,<strong> except that the process blocking function does not seem to work anymore</strong> (even with other programs besides explorer.exe). I am now <strong>able to access unsandboxed processes</strong> even while inside the sandbox. Previously, the explorer.exe didn't work but the process blocking functions did.</div>

				<div class="content">i've tried v1.0.0.3 and now there are no errors at all. However, the processes blocking function is not working (taskmanager can view unsandboxed processes, and the sandboxed processes can access unsandboxed processes).<br>

=============================<br>
<br>
<strong>To give an overview, here are the tried and tested results of all the versions.</strong><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">v1.0.0.1 (First One)</span><br>
Processes That Didn't Work - SandboxieRpcSs.exe and SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe<br>
Explorer Functioning? - No<br>
Process Reading Protected - Yes! (Sandboxed processes could not access unsandboxed processes)<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">v1.0.0.1 (Second One)</span><br>
Processes That Didn't Work - SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe only<br>
Explorer Functioning? - No<br>
Process Reading Protected - Yes! (Sandboxed processes could not access unsandboxed processes)<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">v1.0.0.2</span><br>
Processes That Didn't Work - All Processes Working<br>
Explorer Functioning? - Yes (But with the error message "The procedure entry point RegGetValueW could not be located in the dynamic link library ADVAPI32.dll")<br>
Process Reading Protected - No! (Sandboxed processes WERE ABLE TO access unsandboxed processes)<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">v1.0.0.3</span><br>
Processes That Didn't Work - All Processes Working<br>
Explorer Functioning? - Yes (No visible error messages)<br>
Process Reading Protected - No! (Sandboxed processes WERE ABLE TO access unsandboxed processes)<br>
<br>
Something must have broken the process protection between version 1.0.0.1(second one) and 1.0.0.2</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah, I'm aware of the progression of things.  I just don't have an XP system to test, and Sandboxie won't install in my VirtualBox VM.<br>
<br>
Your last results mean the DLL is not injected into the process, which is why the tests succeed/fail, depending how you look at it.  The installation path to Sandboxie is found, so I don't know why yet.  Try v1.0.0.4, and let's see if the sandboxie processes are enumerated correctly.<br>
<br>
EDIT - I just noticed a " mark hiding in your output there.  That might be the problem.  Go ahead and test 1.0.0.4 anyway cause I want to see the output, but odds are it still won't work correctly.</div>

I'm taking a wild guess and thinking that when it says "Data Read from Process [xxx]:" that it should be all 0's or say that it could not be read right?<br>

				<div class="content">Good!  Try running injtest against another sandboxed process in the same sandbox.  The cmd.exe instance you're launching injtest from will work fine.  Then try launching Windows Explorer via the Run Sandboxed menu.  Running explorer was ultimately the goal here.</div>

				<div class="content">I tried out 1.0.0.5 on my XP system at home, and I can get explorer.exe to open successfully, and the process blocking works.  However I can't launch any programs or files from within a sandboxed explorer or cmd prompt.  I'm not sure exactly why, but it surely has to do with the blocks in place.  Do you guys get the same behavior?<br>
<br>
I also see that non-existing PID in the Dbgview log.  I'm guessing it is the PID of the new process which hasn't been fully created yet.  Since it doesn't really exist yet, the DLL flags it as not-sandboxed and denies access.  This probably causes CreateProcess to fail.  I don't know how to work around that at the moment.<br>
<br>
But ForcedProcess works, and anything started via Start.exe works as well.</div>

At this point, I don't have a solution.  I have an idea for a possible cause that I'm running by tzuk in the hopes he'll have some insight.  But as it is now, the DLL is functioning as designed.  The key here is this unknown PID that keeps showing up in the Dbgview log and gets blocked.<br>

I'll keep everyone posted on progress.</div>

I've tested out v1.0.0.5. I'm getting the same errors as thantik, "SBIE2313 - Could Not Execute SandboxieRpcSs.exe" and "SBIE2204 - Cannot Start Sandboxed Service RpcSs". All in all, the functionality seems to be similar to v1.0.0.1<br>
<br>
Process blocking does work, but explorer does not open.<br>
<br>
DbgView output a lot of information this time round.<br>

				<div class="content">Alright!  v1.0.0.6 should fix the problems.  Since I was finally able to reproduce it, turns out I was right in my guess.  The mysterious PID is what would be SandboxieRpcSs or SandboxieDcomLaunch (depending on the error).  So I added <em>another</em> check: if the target process tests not sandboxed (which happens with our mysterious PID), then it checks if it is a child process of the currently sandboxed process and allows the call (since all child processes of sandboxed processes are also sandboxed).  Now the PID is found.<br>
<br>
With this change I was able to get Firefox to run, explorer to run, and I was able to launch other processes from a sandboxed cmd prompt and a sandboxed explorer window.</div>
