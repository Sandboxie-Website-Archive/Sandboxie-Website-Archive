				<h3>Chrome starts before SB services [SOLVED]</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sat Dec 30, 2017 10:26 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Sam777</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I installed Sandboxie on a friend's computer who has Win10. Then installed Chrome inside a sandbox (chrome is not installed outside of sandboxie). Every time Chrome is started it takes 4-5 seconds before SandboxieRpcSs.exe, SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe and SandboxieCrypto.exe initializes and there is no yellow border around Chrome during this time. <br>
<br>
I noticed on my Win 7 computer, Sandboxie's services start before or at the same time as Chrome, so I'm a little concern about my friend's security. Is the delay normal on a Win 10 machine?</div>

<br>
Is the Sandboxie service set to start automatically with Windows?<br>
Is Sandboxie Control set to automatically start? <br>
What are the antivirus, Chrome and Sandboxie versions involved? <br>
<br>
The border will not show if Sandboxie control is not running. Here's an example of that:<br>
<a href="viewtopic06710671.html?f=17&amp;t=25259" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=25259</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Every time Chrome is started it takes 4-5 seconds before SandboxieRpcSs.exe, SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe and SandboxieCrypto.exe initializes </div></blockquote>
You mean that those .exes do not show up in Sandboxie control, or ...?  <br>
What are the exact repro steps you are following? <br>
<br>

				<div class="content">Hi Barb,<br>
Sandboxie is setup to start with windows automatically and the control panel starts automatically, too.<br>
Chrome - v61.0.3163.100 &amp; Comodo Internet Suite v10.0.2.6420 (anti-virus).<br>
Chrome and Sandboxie are set as trusted applications. Nothing prevents them from running whatever they need to.<br>
Chrome is installed inside a sandbox only and not outside of Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
Normally when something is ran inside a sandbox - SandboxieRpcSs.exe, SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe and SandboxieCrypto.exe, will initialize before any applications do. On my friend's machine however, Chrome will initialize first and after 4-5 seconds SB's 3 exe files (mentioned above) will start. <br>
<br>
So from watching the sandbox in SB's control panel - Chrome.exe starts and is listed. Then 4-5 seconds later, SandboxieRpcSs.exe, SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe and SandboxieCrypto.exe show up. While the three SB's files are not running there is no yellow border around Chrome. When those 3 files are listed in the sandbox, the yellow border is present. It appears as if Chrome starts without being sandboxed for 4-5 seconds. I don't think that's normal behavior but since I don't have Win10, I wasn't sure.</div>

				<div class="content">Sandboxed processes are sandboxed before they start. It sounds like Chrome is hanging for a few seconds (for some reason) on your friend's machine right after it loads. I would investigate the Chrome extensions that are installed.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Sam777,<br>
<br>
Try disabling all the non-required startup applications, including the Antivirus, and see if that affects the behavior. If it does, then you can start re-enabling them one by one to see what may be causing the delay. <br>
<br>
As Curt mentioned, the program is Sandboxed, it doesn't start outside Sandboxie. You can test the steps I provided on my first response to see how it works.<br>
<br>
Also, what happens if you run a different program in the Sandbox (anything other than Chrome)? Do you see the same behavior? <br>
Be sure to test using the latest beta and creating a new Sandbox with default settings.<br>

				<div class="content">I ran Firefox &amp; IE sandboxed - Sandboxie started right away. There wasn't any delay with the 3 exe files starting up. At this point I knew it had something to do with Chrome directly. I found out the problem but I don't know how to fix it.<br>
<br>
I couldn't get chrome to work inside a sandbox when I first installed it. It would start but no webpage would display and there wasn't any errors. I googled for a solution and someone said to append <strong>--no-sandbox</strong> to the target path of Chrome's shortcut. <br>
<br>
When Chrome's sandbox is disabled it says something about an unsupported commandline line but the webpage displays and one can surf the net. However, SB lags for 4-5 seconds. When Chrome's sandbox is enabled, SB's 3 exe files start right away but Chrome fails to display a webpage. I'm not sure what to do with this information.</div>

<br>
We have a dedicated thread for installing browsers inside Sandboxie.Here's the latest information we added regarding Chrome: <a href="viewtopic15281528.html?p=127365#p127365" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?p=127365#p127365</a><br>
<br>
As for the behavior you are reporting, aside from the small delay, are you experiencing any functionality issues? <br>

				<div class="content">The same problem started happening with Firefox, too (firefox starting before sandboxie). After additional troubleshooting I figured out what was happening and would like to share what I did.<br>
<br>
It actually doesn't have anything to do with Chrome or Firefox. Apparently, Comodo HIPS can cause Sandboxie itself to temporally delay on initializing a sandbox. HIPS is disabled by default when you install Comodo, so unless you enabled it this solution might not be for you. <br>
<br>
To fix it, go into HIPS settings and remove all instances of Sandboxie and click OK. For me there were 3 references. Then open HIPS again and click ADD to open a new rule. Then click on BROWSE - RUNNING PROCESSES. Another window will open. Click on <em>SbieCtrl.exe</em> and click OK. Under Ruleset select <em>allowed application</em> and click OK. Now the sandbox should start without being delayed.</div>
