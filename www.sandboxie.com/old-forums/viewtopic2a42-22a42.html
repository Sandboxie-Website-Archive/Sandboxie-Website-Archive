				<div class="content">This is a great little program. I've used it with installers of programs to see exactly what is going where. Probably used it for that more than for browsing actually. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I noticed at Download.com  that Sandboxie has only about 500 downloads since something like March, 2005?<br>
<br>
I'd like to see a site makeover and have Sandboxie presented in a more exciting way. Look at what Greenborder.com is doing. 40 000 downloads in a couple weeks!<br>
<br>
I really just want you, the author so do well, because I really like this software and want it to be around for a long, long time.<br>
<br>
Good luck!  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>

				<div class="content">The recognition will not be long in coming ... a slightly-older version of Sandboxie has been distributed on the free cover CD/DVD of COMPUTER SHOPPER for more than one issue.  That prompted me to come to the web site for more complete information, as well as the most recent stable version.<br>
<br>
Sandboxie has been picked up by the tech-support newsletter (claims 60K subscribers) Gizmo (Ian) Richards <em>Tech Support Alert,</em> as the "Best Free Browser Protection Utility, updated as of July 25, 2006.<br>
