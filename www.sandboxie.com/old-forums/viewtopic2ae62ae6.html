I've been reading about bitbox. Is there any benefit to incorporating Virtualbox into sandboxie as they have done?</div>

BitBox Could Be Safest Windows Browser Ever<br>
<br>
German security technologies company Sirrix AG has recently released what some critics are calling the most secure web browser in existence: a sandboxed version of Mozilla firefox, known as BitBox.<br>
<br>
What makes this variation of Firefox most intriguing is that the web browser runs completely independent of Microsoft Windows (or Linux) . The program uses VirtualBox 4.04 (a software virtualization program by Sun Microsystems) and a securely locked-down ("hardened") implementation of Debian 6 Linux.<br>
<br>
When BitBox is launched, the user is said to have all of the same Internet experiences as they would when running Firefox 4 in its standard format.<br>
<br>
A shared folder between both operating systems is accessible through a separate user account. To keep things extra secure, uploads and Internet access are disabled on the base operating system once BitBox is launched. <br>
<br>
Its greatest feature, however, rests in the fact that every time the browser is restarted, BitBox resets to a different certified boot image.<br>
<br>
This means that any existing malware that might have come through in the previous session is isolated and eliminated -- all without having to continually run an antivirus scan of the system to weed out each individual piece of malware.<br>
<br>
As it stands, BitBox runs on Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7, in addition to various Linux distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE and Gentoo.<br>
<br>
Note that the Bitbox download file is a whopping 900 MB.<br>

Seriously, one of the dumbest ideas I've seen in a while! <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":o" title="Surprised"><br>

Thanks for the info though warwagon, I couldn't find anything about BitBox earlier. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>

				<div class="content">well it sounds that you want Sandboxie to turn into a VM. If thats your request, then you are sorely misguided about virtualization and sandboxing and their differences. I recommend that you go read up on the subject before posting such requests.</div>
