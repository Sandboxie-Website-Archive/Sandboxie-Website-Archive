Disabled but not uninstalled: MalwareBytes Pro and Zone Alarm firewall.<br>
Both of those are also used on my notebook, where 5.11.8 works w/Cyberfox.<br>

I made a Process Monitor log file. Hopefully I let it run long enough - because I know the output gets big.<br>

				<div class="content">Yes, we received the email as well as other "comments."<br>
<br>
As the email stated, and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">I will reiterate</span></strong>...you would need to do the following:<br>
<strong><br>
You need to disable/remove known 3rd party security products (Voodoo shield and others.)<br>
You then need to try FF w/o any addons / extensions.</strong><br>
<br>
Otherwise, the Devs nor I have a clear indication of what the issue is...right now, it's those 2 things as they are 100% known to cause issues.<br>
<br>
As your PML files show 3rd party security programs and extensions that are known/and could cause issues with SBIE.<br>
<br>
That would be your starting point.<br>
<br>
Note: Be careful what you state in an email. ALL email is reviewed &amp; disseminated with Invincea.</div>

Nothing in the code change affected Chrome. Again, it's a beta. For mission critical you should be using Stable v5.10, unless something in the beta addresses a problem you are having. The change logs are posted, <a href="http://beta.sandboxie.com/" class="postlink">http://beta.sandboxie.com</a><br>
<br>
As for setting chrome / default. Well, you might want to look @ Chrome first. Make sure it's set correctly outside of the SB. Contents of SB are deleted (or new SB created) and then try it. You may also look at a new Chrome profile. You may also want to check Google Chromiums Change logs too and see what they may have changed.</div>

Hi ingber, I saw your earlier post a few minutes ago. There is another user at Wilders reporting something similar to what you are experiencing, also in W10. You might like to read his posts and my replies   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">. Anyway, for testing, I installed Chrome in W7, once I clicked Dont ask again, I didn't get the message sandboxed or unsandboxed again.<br>

				<div class="content">If you click on the don't ask again, while it does solve it, it doesn't seem to address a root problem. Either its a Win 10 / Chrome and/or SBIE bug.<br>
Because if you select YES as default (Even if it's on the host as default) and then go into settings, you can see it still isn't set as default.  <br>
<br>
Clicking "don't ask again" is a work around until the root is figured out. Curt is aware of it now, I sent him a Windows Step recorder of it. <br>
<br>
I noticed my Google Account sync had disconnected as well. But, then it connected correctly. <br>
<br>
This is Chrome v50.2661.102m x64.<br>
<br>
I'll see what I can find in the Chromium change logs.</div>

				<div class="content">When Sandboxed,  "Chrome is not your default browser" seems to be in Win 10 at the moment. Both regular Win 10 and the FR versions. <br>
Chrome 32/64.<br>
<br>
Clicking "don't ask again" does hide the message, but it doesn't allow you to set Chrome as the default when sandboxed. Even though you have it as the default in Windows.  Unsure where the problem is, Chrome or otherwise. <br>
<br>
This was with Chrome 50.0.2661.102m (32/54)<br>
<br>
This doesn't happen in 5.11.7, but that doesn't necessarily mean much at the moment.</div>
