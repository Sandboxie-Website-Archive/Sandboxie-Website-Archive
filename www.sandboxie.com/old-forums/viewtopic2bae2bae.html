Title: "Sandboxie Lead Developer".<br>
<br>
Why the lead developer, someone that should spend the time just coding, debugging, researching, ... is the main person in charge of giving support in the forum? Something like, in the case of Sandboxie, maybe does not require a person doing a full time job, but the lead developer? Seriously? <br>
<br>
When Ronen was the only person in charge of the project that was something that had to be as there was not alternative. But now, with a company and a team behind the product, what is the point for that?<br>
<br>
What happens with the other members of the team? Why are not they actively supporting the product in the forum?</div>

				<div class="content">Am I the only one that feels more sorry for him rather than disappointed?  I'm happy he's been responsive (and my view of him is positive, grats bro that wasn't easy to accomplish in the wake of tzuk) but is it really the best place for him to spend his time?<br>
<br>
Also the new webpage shows a list of corporate customers including SKYPE which happens to be one of the few programs I had issues with while using 4.x versions (available before Invincea was publicly involved but during their original ownership) <br>
<a href="../index9734.html?CommercialUse" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?CommercialUse</a><br>
<br>
They are a customer and they haven't helped you disasm/solve previous issues reported here?! Just WOW! Or was there a point they became customers and helped resolve the CPU issues I saw silently? TBH the silent part if true wouldn't help me rest any easier....I'm tempted to bring the computer I experienced this on out of storage just to test. =(<br>
<br>
PS: Thank you curt for not ignoring the common folk! <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"></div>

Everybody is happy with Curt being responsive. If he was not being responsive, the support would be actually dead, at least here in the forum.</div>
