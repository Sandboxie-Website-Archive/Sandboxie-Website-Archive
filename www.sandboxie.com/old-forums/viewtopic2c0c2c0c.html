<br>
Steve again - wanted to let you know how excited we are to be working with this community. Hopefully you saw the post I made in the announcements section the other day/that was reposted here - easy to find if not "Show your stuff..." and I am the author. <br>
<br>
We've had some good conversations going on around the idea and already have a handful of video submissions come across...keep them coming!!! We want to show the world that Sandboxie is a powerful tool!!! <br>
<br>
I also wanted you to know that I've created a Sandboxie group on LinkedIn that is open to all to join/participate in - I know there are literally thousands and thousands of IT/InfoSec pros using the tool - so join that group if you're at all inclined and share some experiences with others in the business community. <br>
<br>
More from me soon! Thanks!!! <br>
<br>
Steve</div>

				<div class="content">I am really glad to see Invincea so enthusiastic about Sandboxie. You guys were smart to integrate Sandboxie's virtualization technology into FreeSpace. Keep up the good work. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>

				<div class="content">I think the idea is really good, but 4 months later the group looks abandoned. It has 1 discussion (which has a title without a word of content), 1 spam and mostly Invincea employees as members.<br>
I think it damages Sandboxie's brand, which defeats the entire purpose.<br>
<br>
In case you want to keep the group, I would suggest the following:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The group's title should have a description and not just the word "Sandboxie". For example, "Isolating programs with Sandboxie" or "Sandboxie virtual protection". If you want to be bold, even "Sandboxing programs" or "Software protection using sandboxes".</li>
<li>Don't use Sandboxie's icon as the group's thumbnail. I know it's a hard decision. But it's supposed to be a security discussion group, not an product page. It should be a thumbnail that symbolizes virtual protection.</li></ol>
Just my 2 cents.</div>
