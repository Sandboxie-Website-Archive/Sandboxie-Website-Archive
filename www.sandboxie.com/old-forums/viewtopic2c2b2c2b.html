It means it is added globally and you will need to use the Software Compatibility tool to remove it (Configure --&gt; Software compatibility). 
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>why is LastPass listed here?</div></blockquote>
It was probably detected by Sandboxie in the past and added to your global templates. <br>
<br>
I installed LastPass on Firefox and then launched it Sandboxed. LastPass appeared just fine. Please try a new Sandbox with default settings to see if that solves the problem. <br>
You can also try removing the lastpass template as explained above, to see if that makes a difference. <br>
<br>
If the issue persists, please try the latest beta:<br>

Are you using any security software? <br>

more info:<br>
in the Sandbox Settings - Default Box panel, Applications | Security/Privacy i see: [--] LastPass<br>
<br>
what does [--] mean?<br>
why is LastPass listed here?
</div></blockquote>[--] means that the setting comes from a template, as a result of having it listed under [GlobalSettings] in the Sandboxie configuration file (Sandboxie.ini):<br>
<br>
[GlobalSettings]<br>
...<br>
Template=LastPass<br>
...<br>
<br>
In other words, that is normal and correct for all sandboxes, since Sandboxie detected that LastPass is being used.<br>
My LastPass icon is at the top, next to the address bar. But I use Cyberfox, so I don't know of any problems with Firefox.<br>
I assume that you have Deleted Contents of the sandbox, since that will force Firefox to re-read the profile files from unsandboxed Firefox the next time that it runs sandboxed.<br>
Also, you might try using "Customize" when not sandboxed, move the icon from the add-on bar so that it's next to the address bar, and make sure that you have Deleted Contents of the sandbox before running Firefox sandboxed, again.</div>

				<div class="content">i tried everything Barb suggested, but no help.<br>
next i tried disabling some of my add-ons. that seemed to help, but wasn't consistent. so i disabled all the add-ons except lastpass. that fixed it. now i am adding them back 1 at a time to see which one breaks it. i had 10 add-ons enabled.</div>
