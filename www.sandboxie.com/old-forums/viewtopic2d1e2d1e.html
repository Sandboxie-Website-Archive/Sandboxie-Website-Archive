				<div class="content">I've been using Sandboxie and find it very impressive at keeping malware off my machines, even to the point of deliberately importing malware to use the various methods of either Recovery or Deletion of the sandbox contents.<br>
<br>
I blog about computer security, which is aimed at all users not just newbies, and as technology changes so protection programs change with it.  Some for the better and some not.<br>
<br>
I have no affiliate or cloaked links and Sandboxie was outside my normal criteria of posting articles about freeware.  <br>
<br>
I decided to write an article because of its low cost, simplicity of use and the protection it offers.  In a nutshell, if a user is using Sandboxie and gets a malware infection then it usually because they have 'Recovered' it.<br>
<br>
Comparing the low cost lifetime license with the extortionate fees required by some of the major anti-malware vendors, it is an absolute bargain.<br>
<br>
I have also created a couple of short video tutorials to go with the article, but I will aso add more to thee as there is so much to offer in what is a very small but extremely powerful program.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://cotojo.wordpress.com/2008/07/09/" class="postlink">The article can be found here</a>  and through various other forums etc is starting to get a reasonable amount of hits.</div>
