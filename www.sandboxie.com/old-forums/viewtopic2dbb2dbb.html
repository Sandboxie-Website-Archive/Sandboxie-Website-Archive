				<div class="content">ok maybe i had found this over a year ago but i just looked over it. until recently i needed to install the full quicktime because of some super speciall .mov files that did not play well on anything including zoomplayer and vlc. i installed quicktime and then iTunes, then i was able to view my videos without problems and experience iTunes with 0 impact on system performance. this is since itunes runs around 5 processes/services that are alwoys on. on sandboxie i was able to configure it to kill these processes when i was done.<br>
<br>
its alos the best tool for privacy out there. think of this, you need to look for a birthday present for your kids on the only comp on the house:<br>
run a browser on sandboxie <br>
use a shredder to delete the sand box when your finish.<br>
<br>
no matter how awesome your kids may be in computers the wont find a trace of your activity. this goes for FBI and DEA also.</div>
