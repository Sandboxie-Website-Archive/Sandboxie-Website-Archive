				<h3>Encrypted PGP Disk volume not protected by default</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Tue Jan 16, 2007 11:53 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I'm using an encrypted PGP Disk volume mountet as drive T:<br>
notepad.exe running sandboxed is nevertheless able creating, deleting and editing files permantly on drive T: - breakthrough Sandboxie<br>
<br>
Online help gives an example for an solution for another product "TrueCrypt":<br>
	[GlobalSettings]<br>
	HarddiskVolume=\Device\TrueCryptVolumeT<br>
	HarddiskVolume=T:<br>
In my case I looked in the device manager and found a device named PGPdisk and added this line to my Sandboxie.ini. <br>
	HarddiskVolume=\Device\PGPdisk,asis<br>
Now my PGP volume T: is protected and can't be modified by sandboxed programs.<br>
<br>
Question:<br>
I found many other devives listed in the device manager - which I do not exactly know . Example: ASPI32, FileDisk, mountmgr, pagedfrg, ...<br>
Are these all possible security holes ? <br>
Maybe there exists an device that can access the computer file system, or the disk at low level - and a sandboxed Programm will establish an connection to this device (that resides outside the sandbox) and then use this device to modify something outside the sandbox ? Maybe the topic "Paragon Partition Manager breakthrough Sandboxie" is the same problem - a device installed outside the sandbox is contacted from inside the sandbox ?<br>
<br>
It it possible permitting all direct device access inside the sandbox, so that an encrypted PGP Disk volume and other products are protected by default ?</div>

There isn't such a device by default, that I know of.  And if you find out the next Windows Update install such a device, you can always add:<br>
<br>
ClosedFilePath=\device\TheEvilDevice<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> Maybe the topic "Paragon Partition Manager breakthrough Sandboxie" is the same problem - a device installed outside the sandbox is contacted from inside the sandbox ?</div></blockquote>

This is entirely possible, in version 2.64, if the new device -- such as your PGP disk -- is mounted after Sandboxie has taken inventory of your drives, and noted to itself, what are the hard drive eligible for sandboxing.<br>
<br>
But, similar to what I said in that other post:  In version 2.7, there is no such inventory, there is no more HarddiskVolume setting, and drives become eligible for sandboxing as soon as they are mounted into the system.</div>
