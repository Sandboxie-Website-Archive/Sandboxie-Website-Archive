				<h3>Run email reader doesn't launch Thunderbird [SOLVED]</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Thu Jan 25, 2018 9:13 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>phrab</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I have 2 computers: WinXP SP-3 &amp; Win 10...both with the latest Thunderbird.  I just installed Thunderbird on my Win 10 computer.  I went to  Sandboxie&gt;Show window&gt;sandbox&gt;Default box&gt;Sandbox settings&gt;Forced Folders &amp; added "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Thunderbird" to the list.  Also, under the settings&gt;Applications, I checked Thunderbird (which is my default email reader).  I restarted Win 10.<br>
<br>
1) At first, when I downloaded emails from both my gmail &amp; roadrunner accounts, the gmail emails disappeared after closing Thunderbird &amp; deleting contents of Sandboxie.  I think I solved that when I added the Forced Folder above, but I'm not sure.  If anyone knows what I did wrong, please tell me.<br>
<br>
2) When I right click on Sandboxie &amp; choose Default box&gt;run email reader, it launches Google Chrome, just like it does if I choose "run web browser" &amp; I don't know why.  I want it to launch Thunderbird...the way it does on my WinXP machine.  Can someone tell me how to do this?<br>
<br>
Thank you in advance,<br>
Phil</div>

<br>
Please follow these steps in order to properly setup/test your email client:<br>
Setup: <a href="../ApplicationsSettings.html#email" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/ApplicationsSettings#email</a><br>
Test: <a href="../TestEmailConfiguration.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/TestEmailConfiguration</a><br>
<br>
Regarding launching Chrome instead of Thunderbird, please check what's the default email application listed for Windows 10 (Click Start --&gt; Type "default app settings" , ensure Thunderbird is listed under Email). <br>
<br>

Hello phrab,<br>
<br>

Spoke a little too soon.  I followed the above steps to test my email program (which is now the default &amp; which Sandboxie will launch thank you).  The steps said to create message &amp; not send it, &amp; then delete the sandbox &amp; see if the drafts were still there.<br>
<br>
However, Thunderbird doesn't keep a draft until you click "Save".  If I did click "save", then deleting the sandbox didn't delete the saved draft.  If I didn't click "Save", then there were no drafts when I deleted the sandbox.  Just wanted to make sure that I had tested it correctly.  Perhaps the instructions at the link above should add:<br>
<br>
Run your email program sandboxed under Sandboxie. (You can use the Run Email Reader command from the Tray Icon Menu of Sandboxie Control.)<br>
Compose a test draft message to yourself. Don't send it.<br>
[Save the draft].  This is the instruction that I would add.<br>
Quit your email program. If your email program suggests to send the test message, disregard the suggestion.</div>
