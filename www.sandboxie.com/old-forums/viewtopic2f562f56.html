				<div class="content">Everyone,<br>
<br>
A few weeks ago I wrote in response to one of @Buster’s posts that we would be investing in a full time forum support resource for the Sandboxie community.  I explained that Sandboxie isn’t just important to Invincea, it’s a critical core piece of the commercial product that has brought us so much success over the years. As such, we want to continue to invest in Sandboxie so that all of you, the Sandboxie community, receive the level of support and attention you deserve.<br>
<br>
With that I’d like to introduce all of you to Craig@invincea, your new dedicated support engineer!  Craig comes to us with a long history of providing expert level support to user communities like yourselves, and we’re very proud to call him our newest Invincean.  Please join me in welcoming Craig to the Invincea and Sandboxie families!<br>
<br>
Norm</div>

				<div class="content">Good news indeed.  Don't post very often since, for me, SBIE has been quite flawless, but I admit, I rarely tax SBIE; just browse mainly.    <br>
<br>
Anyway, I too welcome you Craig.   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

The forum does a great job in answering the huge majority of questions people seem to have. I'l try and recreate issues for users. Bugs &amp; problems I'll look at too and work with Curt and his team.</div>
