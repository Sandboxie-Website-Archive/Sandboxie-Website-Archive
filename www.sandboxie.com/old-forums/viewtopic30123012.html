				<h3>Sticky Password (again!) &amp; AVG IS and Firefox [SOLVED]</h3>

				<div class="content">AVG (ouside SB) is stopping Sticking Password working sandboxed with Firefox. If I disable AVG and then start FF &amp; SP sandboxed, all is well, even if I reenable AVG after. With AVG enabled first, SP thinks that its FF extension is not loaded.<br>
<br>
This problem started in the last day or so, and was not resolved by a FF update today to from 59b11 to 59b12. SP seems to work ok sandboxed with IE sandboxed and AVG enabled, well the logo "lights up" but I would need to change some SP settings for it to work fully. <br>
<br>
AVG &amp; SP templates are enabled, and for SP following past problems I also have the following in sandboxie.ini:<br>
OpenFilePath=spNMHost.exe,D:\Documents\OneDrive\Sync\default.spdb<br>
OpenFilePath=stpass.exe,D:\Documents\OneDrive\Sync\default.spdb<br>
<br>
I have tried SB 5.22, 5.23b5 &amp; 5.23b6 with the same result.<br>
<br>
Windows 10 v17109 b16299.248; AVG IS v18.1.3044, last updated 12/2 and it has been working ok since that time; SP 8.1.0.103</div>

I just finished setting up a VM with SP + FF stable 58 +AVG + Sbie 5.23.6 and I am not experiencing the same issues. I had to enable the AVG template or it would not work at all. <br>
<br>
I launched SP and Firefox in the same Sandbox and I was able to open a gmail session via SP (it did not remember the password, but this behavior was the same outside Sandboxie).<br>
Can you provide exact repro steps?<br>
<br>
Can you please test in a new Sandbox with default settings and let me know the outcome? <br>
Also, please post a copy of your Sandboxie configuration file, so that I can try to replicate with your settings. <br>

Hello henryg,<br>
<br>
I just finished setting up a VM with SP + FF stable 58 +AVG + Sbie 5.23.6 and I am not experiencing the same issues. I had to enable the AVG template or it would not work at all. <br>
<br>
I launched SP and Firefox in the same Sandbox and I was able to open a gmail session via SP (it did not remember the password, but this behavior was the same outside Sandboxie).</div></blockquote>
I do not open sites via SP, I use my favourites and SP only comes into play when login type field are detected. I assume the SP toolbar icon in Firefox in your VM was not inactive/greyed out? <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Can you provide exact repro steps? </div></blockquote>

There are no steps to repro? I start Firefox and Sticky Password which are forced into my default sandbox [Internet_Drop], and both have been working happily for some time now. For the last few days, both load as normal but SP says its extension is not loaded when I use the SP "target" to check. DIsable AVG and load them and all is well; even after AVG is re-enabled, as I said originally.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Can you please test in a new Sandbox with default settings and let me know the outcome? </div></blockquote>
No difference. <br>
<br>
BTW when I removed my sandboxie.ini file and caused SB to recreate one, it did not pick up AVG at all; others ok. I had to manually copy and paste the template line into the ini else nothing would run.<br>

The behaviour is the same on my laptop, but then I use pretty much the same sandboxie ini settings, and some, but not all, of the same Firefox extensions. AVG is on both but set up individually, so there could be some differences.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello henryg ,<br>
<br>
I tested using your Internet_Drop settings and  did not experience any problems. However, I had to manually add the AVG template and click about 4 times before SP reacted to my clicks. <br>
<br>
Just in case, here are my steps:<br>
Launched Firefox v58.0.2 in the Sandbox.<br>
From Firefox, clicked on the SP icon (I had to click a few times.<br>
Got the popup for SP, entered the password. <br>
Icon is no longer grayed out. <br>
<br>
Please try deleting the contents of your Sandbox, or re-creating it and re-test.  Have you reboot your machine since the changes to AVG went thru? If not, give that a shot if you haven't already.<br>
<br>
Also, any chance SP is running outside Sandboxie as well? Perhaps that's affecting the behavior? <br>
I saw the Malware bytes template in your config file , are you running MWBs? If so, any chance it is affecting things? <br>
<br>
If all fails, see if AVG has any quarantined files, or is blocking anything Sandboxie related. <br>
<br>

				<div class="content">Hi Barb<br>
<br>
I've done all of that, and my sandboxes are in ram so clear every time I shut down. But I have also cleared them manually.<br>
<br>
The 4 click SP thing seems to be a load time issue. If you click once and wait a bit, I think you will find it will load, but just in case I did the multiple-click start and it made no difference.<br>
<br>
Malwarebytes is only used for ad-hoc scans and is not loaded unless run manually. I have tried running SP in and out the sandbox to no effect. I do not run SP in and out at the same time.<br>
<br>
I found that if, with AVG enabled/loaded, I load Firefox and SP, the SP icon is geyed out in Firefox, but as soon as I disable AVG the SP icon "lights up" and all is well. There are no files quaratined in AVG, and my Sandboxie install location (non-standard) is set as an exception in AVG. Until now AVG has worked flawlessly with Sandboxie. I tried adding the SP location as an exception in AVG, but no difference. I think it pretty conclusive that it is an AVG/Sandboxie issue as all is well outside of SB. I assume you used the same AVG version as me, and fully updated.<br>
<br>
Where next, if anywhere?</div>

<br>
I cannot reproduce the issue using the same setup (with the exception of Malware Bytes).<br>
<br>
Try fully removing AVG, ensuring no traces are left and rebooting the machine (and if possible MWBS). Then, after confirming Sandboxie works as expected, re-install AVG to see if that makes a difference.<br>
<br>
Also, check your temporary files for any AVG related stuff (or...if possible, just nuke them all. Up to you, however). <br>
<br>
