				<div class="content">I use 64bit system, many security app has drawback on 64bit system.<br>
And after reading this site faqs, I've my own doubt for sandboxie.<br>
Since Sandboxie 64bit would have less protection compared to 32bit one<br>
<br>
I even email tzuk about my concern about his willingness to improve 64bit<br>
Nevertheless he never answer me directly, but he made something much better<br>
Making sandboxie 64bit to be near perfect, and gives me all around protection that I could dream of.<br>
<br>
For a start it will protect my browsing seasons, nothing ever got through from it. And I hope it will never will.<br>
Testing new untrusted application is very easy and safe<br>
Sometimes I install thing or two inside sandboxie, just to keep my pc tidy, clean, and safe.<br>
And there are still limitless potential I shall continue to explore<br>
<br>
Long live sandboxie, the first frontier mission on making 64bit environtment safer . Cheers</div>
