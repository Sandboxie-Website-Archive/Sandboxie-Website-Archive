				<div class="content">Hi. I run the program sportsbook.ag through sandboxie. It always used to work. The program actually loads up but then when i log in. The lobby just gets stuck and i cant click on anything on the program. This occurs after i log into the program.<br>
<br>
When i run it through sandboxie. It asks me to log in and i log in and then it tries to connect to server and it does but then nothing really appears and i cant click on anything. Ive used sandboxie to run this program for years and i dont understand why <br>
the lobby wont load.<br>
<br>
I deleted the program and reinstalled for both sandboxie and sportsbook.ag Ive never not been able to run this type of program through sandboxie and im confused as to why i am recieving this error now. I do not know how to get any log files or anything since the program just freezes after it loads up.<br>
<br>
Can anybody help me with any advice? <br>
Vik</div>
