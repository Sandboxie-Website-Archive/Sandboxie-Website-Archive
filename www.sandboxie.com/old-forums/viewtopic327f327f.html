				<h3>Sandboxie blocks RSS feeds in Outlook 2010</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Mon Sep 14, 2015 6:46 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">A change in the version of Internet Explorer that I use in Windows 7 (64-bit) has eliminated my ability to receive RSS messages in Outlook 2010 when it is sandboxed.<br>
<br>
Nothing else changed. Within minutes after completing the upgrade from IE 8 to IE 11, I ran Outlook 2010 under Sandboxie, just as I had a thousand times. This time, however, and every time since, I found I did not receive messages from any of my RSS feeds.  Looking at the Send/Receive progress details, I found messages like the following for each feed.  "'Synchronization to RSS Feed . . . . has failed. Outlook cannot download the RSS content from . . . . because of a problem connecting to the server.'<br>
<br>
There's no doubt that Sandboxie is preventing the connection, because when I open Outlook without Sandboxie, the RSS messages are retrieved without any problem. <br>
<br>
Does anyone know what could be causing this, or how to fix it?</div>
