				<div class="content">The configuration settings are kept in the file:<br>
C:\Windows\sandboxie.ini<br>
<br>
You can view that file from the Sandboxie Control menu:<br>
Configure &gt; Edit Configuration<br>
<br>
If you want to do is create a new sandbox using the same settings as an existing sandbox:<br>
Sandbox &gt; Create New Sandbox &gt; name the new sandbox, and use "Copy settings from existing sandbox", pull-down arrow</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks Paul, got it. My question related to the context in which I would have to re-install sandboxie or install it on a different system. To avoid redefining the settings it would be a good idea to import existing setting into a new installation. Coping the sandboxie.ini will do as well.<br>
<br>
BTW. Is sandboxie just in a maintenance mode? the sandboxie.ini file is a property file, a format used by mostly old software.</div>

Some of the items under [GlobalSettngs] might not be correct, but you can probably fix that if there's a "Remove Old Settings" button that shows under Configure &gt; Software Compatibility.<br>
If your Windows logon name has changed, you will wind up with 2 [UserSettings_xxxxxx] sections. You can delete the section with the wrong logon name.<blockquote><div><cite>Parttanna wrote:</cite>BTW.
