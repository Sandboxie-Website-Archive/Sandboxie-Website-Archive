				<h3>Firefox shutdowns and exception breakpoints [SOLVED]</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Wed Jan 10, 2018 2:11 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>howiem</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Windows 7 32bit<br>
Sandboxie 5.22<br>
FireFox 57.0.4<br>
MS Security Essentials<br>
<br>
My Firefox browser tends  to freeze up after using it for a few hours.  My shutdown options then become to 1) manually kill each instance of Firefox.exe in Task Manager, or 2) to right click the <br>
title bar and select Close or use Alt+F4.  <br>
 If I use method 2 the firefox.exe processes do not all close and I frequently,although inconsistently , see the Firefox application error shown in the attachment which is usually (but not always) followed by a SB error SBIE2224 Sandboxed program has crashed: firefox.exe [DefaultBox]<br>
<br>
This issue does not happen in IE 11nor has it happened yet in an unsandboxed FF browser.  <br>
<br>
I searched for this issue in the forums but can't see a match.  Does the next SB beta fix this or is there a fix coming?</div>

<br>
Does the issue occur in a new sandbox with default settings? <br>
Are there any extensions involved?<br>
Does it happen if the AV software is disabled? <br>
Can you please provide the crash dump so we can have a look? <br>
Are there any specific websites being used at the time of the crash?  <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>

				<div class="content">Where is the crash dump located in Win 7?<br>
I am using only two extensions, Roboform Password Manager and One-Tab<br>
Will try it with MS Security Essentials disabled<br>
The web sites vary, but often I have tabs open for Youtube.com and Facebook.com <br>
Sandbox security level in FF is set to 2<br>
I am going to try the new SB beta to see what happens, but for now would appreciate knowing which crash dump file to use and where it is located  for future reference since I cannot find it using Everything</div>
