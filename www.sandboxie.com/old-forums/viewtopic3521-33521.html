What is the setup for the remote session? Is it a VM? Is another host? <br>
I need steps to reproduce the issue and see what is happening.<br>

What I tested before seemed to have worked fine, so I am not sure exactly how are you reproducing the problem. <br>
I can give it another go if you give me exact steps to reproduce the problem . <br>
 <br>
For example:<br>
<br>
1- Install X applications<br>
2- Use blah blah settings<br>
3 - Launch Y Sandboxed<br>
4 - Perform specific action<br>
5 - See the issue.<br>

<strong>Thanks you not read the tread as is said ?<br>
<br>
Yes i know sandboxie is not for that but i can use it and it worked very good for it with OpenWinClass * since Win 10 CU Update with BSODS now.   <br>
There is no other Software out there i testet much things tto run Steam Multiple Times and get Access outside to Windows Desktop things.<br>
<br>
I use it with Multiseat Software Aster V7 from IBIK.    <br>
<br>
So at 1 PC 6 People can work or Play.<br>
<br>
<br>
Problem is that when without * at OpenWinClass then user cannot interact in Windows 10 with Taskbar or other Programms, Settings etc that are not Sandboxed because Steam must be Sandboxed to RUN Multiple Times at 1 PC.   So without * at OpenWinClass user can only Control Steam and Apps or things startet in Sandbox but not Taskbar or System Control Panel or something like that is not running in Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
I think you never read that i wrote same things often that without * this things are not Controlable. because this things cannot be sandboxed and run always in Windows the Taskbar , Start Menur etc .  <br>
<br>
Also with OpenWinClass *   the Windows 10 Apps are not controlable why that ? Can they be Sandboxie or what other things must be set for Windows 10 Apps ?<br>
<br>
Also is ther eno way to fix BlueScreen BSOD at OpenWinClass *   ??? Only with disable it ? but as said i need it .   <br>
<br>
Use Steam In Homestreaming or TightVNC also make bluescreen at  " * "   .<br>
<br>
<br>
Also have Problem since Windows 10 CU that user can set or i set Audio Output for all users a Different but Sandboxie not Saves it always changes when a users changes before it worked. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad">   So every users hers the sound from other if they not change sound output before start game but also if other forgot change same problem <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br>
<br>

Ah I must have missed that when skimming over all the posts. I downloaded and tried it in a VM but it seems Aster has the same issue with the workspace in a VM as it does with stuff in Sandboxie and I can't even see when I move the mouse on an unsandboxed workspace started by aster after a reboot. Doesn't look like I'm gonna get very far testing or reproducing this in a simple VM so I doubt I end up being much help:-/<br>
<br>
I was able to keyboard test one program with the resource access monitor open and only saw two things to attempt opening instead of * but as my mouse wasn't working anyway I couldn't tell if it would change anything.<br>
Instead of<br>
OpenWinClass=*<br>
<br>
Would you be willing to see if adding these two instead changes anything and gets the mouse working? I'd be shocked if it actually did but no harm at least testing it I guess?<br>
