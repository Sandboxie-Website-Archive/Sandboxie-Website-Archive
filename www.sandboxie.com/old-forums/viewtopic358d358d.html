				<h3>Two requests - Integrity levels and Java</h3>

				<div class="content">Two separate requests<br>
<br>
1) Would it be possible to have the sandboxed programs run at Low Integrity by default/ with an option.<br>
<br>
If the entire sandbox is set to low integrity this should have no effect on compatibility. It only changes things when an item leaves the sandbox in the instance of a breakout.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) It would be nice if I could sandbox Java without sandboxing Chrome. Currently this crashes the browser and Java. I don't want Chrome sandboxed, I trust Chrome's security as is and I don't really want to stack anything onto it and needlessly increase attack surface/ possibly cause incompatibilities with the security built in.</div>

				<div class="content">Regarding the low integrity level feature, I believe Didier Stevens brought it to discussion in past, and Tzuk's answer was no. Didier Stevens was suppose to provide a "Contributed Utility", but I've never seen it in that section. Maybe it's there and I just missed it. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"><br>

Anyway, I hope my memory isn't playing any tricks with me. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

				<div class="content">Eh, that's alright. Low integrity is nice but it's not really a priority and if people enabled it without thinking they'd screw up compatibility.<br>
<br>
The Java thing would still be nice. I don't want Chrome in a Sandbox but I'd like Java in one.</div>

Maybe i am incorrect, but can't you add java.exe and javaw.exe to the forced programs but not chrome?<br>
Your might have to open certain communication channels to allow it to interact with chrome though.</div>
