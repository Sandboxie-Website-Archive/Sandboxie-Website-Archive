				<div class="author">by <strong>APMichael</strong></div>
				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Curt@invincea wrote:</cite>Beta 4.17.6 is released. The only big change is that the spooler can now write temp files to its own work folder outside the sandbox.  So this should eliminate the SBIE1319 when printing normally.<br>
There is no way we can test all the various printer drivers and configurations from here, so I need your help in testing this as I want to finish it up and get it released into 4.18 asap....</div></blockquote>
Printing on our networked printer (Brother MFC) works flawless (no error messages). But printing to a PDF file with the well-known "PDFCreator" fails! Double-clicking on SBIE1319 doesn't help. The "PDFCreator" dialog never shows up, regardless how often I restart the print. I hope you can fix this. Thanks!<br>

Is it possible to adjust the print spooler write access ourselves? like we could find out where the driver needs to write its temp files via Resource Access Monitor and then allow that specific path in a menu setting dedicated to this. that way the user can fix the problem themselves instead of relying on you to fix it.</div>

That makes sense, though i think it would be better if instead of it being able to write on any OpenFilePath, we could also add spooler service as an app in the list and apply the OpenFilePath setting to it separately.  i would also suggest that you undo the ease of restriction that you made for spooler service to allow to write to its own temp folder or at least give us an option to disable it(like it could be added in global Software Compatibility list) so we could ensure nothing without our explicit permission could leak out of sandboxie.</div>

Please put the DMP files somewhere so I can download it.<br>
<br>
Chrome won't even allow me to download PDF Creator from pdfforge -- is says it contains malware.  Why are you using this package?<br>
<br>
EDIT:  Firefox won't allow me to download from pdfforge either.  I suggest you try another pdf creator.</div>

Thanks for your reply.<br>
<br>
Sorry, but Chrome tells nonsense (as quite often). And Firefox starts the download without any problem. Do you really not know "PDFCreator"?! It has millions of active users and it is one of the most used free PDF creators! Please try the download again. Thanks.<br>
