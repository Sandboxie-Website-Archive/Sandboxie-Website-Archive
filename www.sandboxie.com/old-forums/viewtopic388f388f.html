				<div class="content">It would be nice if we were able to install MS Office inside a sandbox. So then we could have multiple and fully separated versions of Office installed at the same time. This would be a huge benefit.<br>
<br>
At the moment, the installation fails, maybe because some services are not implemented (TrustedInstaller, IWbemService, SxsInstallW are shown as "not implemented" during installation), or any other reason.<br>
<br>
I have tried Office 2010 without "Click to run" and installation fails inside a sandbox while it does not fails outside the sandbox.<br>

				<div class="content">Office 2010 works just fine in Sandboxie. It's what we use to test. As long as it's not click to run. Did you confirm that it isn't?</div>

				<div class="content">So you have already managed to install Office 2010 inside a sandbox?<br>
<br>
I tried Office 2010 (x86) with Windows 10 (x64). Maybe this is a unlucky combination? Which Windows version and which "bit" version (x86, x64) have you used?<br>
<br>
<strong>Edit:</strong> I tried Windows 10 x86 and the setup aborts, too.<br>
<br>
Here is what happens in detail: After progress bar reaches ~50%, a lot of sandboxie warning messages appear (service not implemented), then the setup begins to roll back all changes and says it could not install Office because of an (unspecified) error.<br>
I am using Office 2010 ProPlus setup DVD with integrated SP2.</div>

Microsoft has a version of 2010 that is Click to Run, EVEN off a DVD. You need to follow the steps here from MS to see if you indeed have that product. It appears that you do. (outlook, office) <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff864733.aspx" class="postlink">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/librar ... 64733.aspx</a>  If that is indeed the case, MS Office will not install inside a SB nor will any MS office program run while sandboxed.<br>
<br>
You can also look for this registry key (may exist for 2010, does for 2013)<br>
If you want to dig into the Windows registry to find Click-to-Run information, you'll need to navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\{90150000-008F-0000-1000-0000000FF1CE}. If this key exists, the Office was installed using the Click-to-Run method.</div>
