				<div class="content">Yes, programs within the same sandbox should interact with other exactly as they normally would.<br>
<br>
And yes, you can generally/probably have UNsandboxed programs interact with programs within a sandbox. You may need to use compatibility settings... And depending what exactly you mean by "interact." <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

I think an example of this would be, if you install Palemoon or Firefox in a sandbox, the browser uses Java or Flash if they are installed outside the sandbox.<br>

For example, I play on a poker site, and I use a 3rd party program that imports hands from a poker site and puts a HUD on the table giving me statistics. When I use sandboxie on the poker site, I can't get my other 3rd party program to recognize that the pokersite is running. Also the pokersite doesn't seem to save hands on the computer.</div>

				<div class="content">It has been a long time since I used Holdem Manager 2 together with Pokerstars software. So I can'r really help you in that. The HEM2 was only on something like a 30 day trial. Seems you need both programs sandboxed to get the HUD display. There might be some recovery settings or direct file access settings you could use maybe.<br>
<br>
I would run those 2 programs anyways unsandboxed. The nature of those programs is quite "static" internet way of traffic.<br>
<br>
Btw internet poker became quite unattractive to me with in the same table half russians etc other nationality/language propably using Skype to communicate with each other and trying to play in cahoots. Also I would prefer sites where those tracker softwares are not allowed.</div>
