				<div class="content">First, I am not a techie. This will be very obvious as I proceed. I have Sandboxie installed on an old Vista Home Premium system. It was working fine for my application. I use it with a Startech 16 Port USB to Serial Multiplexer Adapter Hub (ICUSB23216F) to update 16 handheld bar code scanners used in my inventory business. It was working just fine until a couple of the ports on the adapter started to get quirky. I purchased a new adapter hub and when I connected it, it didn't recognize the same Com Ports as what I am configured for. I have no idea how to fix this. I tried renaming the ports in Device Manager to the ones I believe I need them to be, but it still wants to assign new numbers to about half of them. Can you help me???</div>

<br>
We do not support Windows Vista, however, if you could provide the information required below as well as repro steps, and the results of re-trying after creating a new Sandbox with default settings, we might be able to point you in the right direction.<br>

				<div class="content">Barb: As I mentioned, I'm not literate in techese.  I'm not sure exactly what you are asking me to do. The Windows Version is Vista Home Premium Service Pack 2 64 bit. The Sandboxie is V4.04 64 bit. I have been trying to attach a copy if the Sandboxie.ini but your forum won't allow the extentions .txt, .docx, or .doc so I have not been successful. Is there a way to do this? If you can see how we are configured, it might help. As for creating a new sandbox, I don't have a clue.</div>

<br>
What is the application that you are using, and what's the version of it? <br>
Is there any antivirus software installed? <br>
What are the steps to reproduce the problem? Are you receiving an error message? What's happening, exactly?<br>
<br>
As explained before, we do not support Vista.<br>
Regarding Sandboxie v4.04, that version is deprecated. Please download the latest version of Sandboxie:<br>
<a href="../DownloadSandboxie.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/DownloadSandboxie</a><br>
<br>
And then create a new Sandbox to re-test the issue:<br>
<a href="../SandboxMenu.html#create" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/SandboxMenu#create</a><br>
<br>
If you are very new to Sandboxie, I strongly recommend that you follow this tutorial to familiarize with its features:<br>
<a href="../GettingStarted.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/GettingStarted</a><br>
<br>
To post a copy of your Sandboxie.ini, open Sandboxie control and to Configure--&gt; Edit configuration<br>
Copy-paste the contents in the forum.<br>
Highlight the copied text and click on the "&lt;/&gt;" button to format it (so that it is easy to read).<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>
