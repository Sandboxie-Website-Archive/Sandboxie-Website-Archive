Ist the "<strong>memory consumption issue</strong>" fixed in <strong>4.10 RC</strong> - or - ist it <em>NOT</em> fixed <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?:" title="Question"><br>

When going through the change log, it looked like only the dialog box issue had been fixed.  But, then when I tried to reproduce the memory consumption problem myself, I couldn't repro.  Perhaps it was fixed in the compiler upgrade.  Are you still getting this memory consumption problem?</div>

Hi WongKit, you should use the Force programs feature to force Firefox. You are not supposed to use Force folders to sandbox a program like Firefox.<br>

"Force programs" will not allow me to chose a specific application by its full path. It will match every program that is named firefox.exe which is something I do not want. Besides from that, using this option (instead of forced folders) will also lead to the error I mentioned before ;)</div>

Plus it would break filetype / link association and automatic update functionality of Firefox.</div>

Actually, it is the opposite.  These files should be installed in the windows folder so that it <span style="text-decoration: underline">can</span> apply updates.  If they are in the Sandboxie folder, Windows Update can't find them.</div>

Oh, OK, but Windows doesn't update them, as I checked this before posting, and to be fair I never said you should copy them to the install folder.<br>
<br>
When I said the files shouldn't be in System32, I meant not just copied there, and should be installed with the VC++ redist installers, as I'm aware that's where they go if it's used.<br>
<br>
Anyway like I said, I'm no programmer, and I'm only remembering (more likely misremembering) something I read ages ago, and thought I could be helping.</div>
