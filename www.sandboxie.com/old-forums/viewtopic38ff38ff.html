It's a false positive. BorderGuard was done with Autohotkey. Some antivirus has that dislike with Autohotkey and AutoIt.<br>
<br>
If someone has afraid to use BorderGuard he can run it sandboxed to check...; can use SandboxDiff to monitorize their "suspicious" changes in files/registry also...<br>
<br>
After that they can send an "audit report" to Spyware Doctor, Process Guard and others guys. So these guys can to increase their white list... Good luck.<br>
<br>
BorderGuard can start with Sandboxie smoothly. It's enough: 1- to use the <em>tzuk</em>'suggestion in post above; 2- to use <em>Micahs</em>'Launcher too. Unlike others, to me it's "worth the hassle". In fact to me "the hassle" is running Sandboxie without BorderGuard... I like it.<br>
<br>
<em>Micahs</em>: thanks a lot for this interesting and useful utility. Thanks for to allow Sandboxie'users to enjoy their advantageous feature also. Nice work!</div>

Other people may find the tool out of this place, without source code or without the knowledge to understand it, so if it has been whitelisted they will know they are using a safe application.</div>

				<div class="content">As Kissol said, alerts on this program are just false detections.  I also agree with Kissol that the greater hassle would be running without BorderGuard.  I can't believe such useful and simple functionality is not built into Sandboxie to begin with.<br>
<br>
But as far as Spyware Doctor or Process Guard or whatever goes, can't you just tell these programs that BorderGuard is safe and can be ignored?  Every security program I've ever used had the ability to be told what is safe and/or could be ignored without completely turning it off.  If it can't, perhaps consider switching to another security product...  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> <br>
<br>
So Micahs, any progress with an option to show borders on all running sandboxed windows even if they are not in focus?  That would be really useful...  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">  Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Anonymous wrote:</cite>I can't believe such useful and simple functionality is not built into Sandboxie to begin with.</div></blockquote>Haha thats because the Borderguard app posted into this thread is a AHK file. It is a document file that is run through AHK's engine when double clicked so it can/will be executed.<br>
<br>
Sandboxie isn't built off AHK though (now that would be interesting...) so therefore, it isn't possible to just "incorporate" this app into Sandboxie, unless it was C++ code... <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>

				<div class="content">Sorry for the lapse. Without the email notifications, it's harder to keep up with this. It seems I've missed a fair amount of action!<br>
<br>
Yes, it is a false positive. (But of course you wouldn't take my word for that. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> ) I will recompile and repost. The version of AHK I used may have false detections, but the latest is probably ok. For now! As always, the source is included if you want to peruse or compile. I will do this soon. <br>
<br>
As far as the "all windows highlighted" thing: It's percolating. I think I know how to do it. It's just a matter of time.<br>
<br>
I have, though, made progress on the launcher. It replaces "Start.exe" and renames it "Start.exe.REDIR.exe", running it to sandbox programs. It also launches any program you have selected for global launch. Then, it looks to see if there are any programs listed to run for this particular exe. When there are no more sandboxed apps, it will kill the stuff it ran (you specify for each one whether it will be shut down or not.)<br>
<br>
Some progress is better than no progress, I guess.</div>

<br>
I'm considering adding this feature to Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
I've traditionally not wanted to do that because I always thought about painting the borders from <em>within</em> the sandboxed program, and did not want to introduce more differences than how the program would normally run.<br>
<br>
But your idea is better, in that the painting is done by some <em>other</em> program.<br>
<br>
So I hope you're ok with that, and I wanted you to take that into account when you're considering further development of your own tool.</div>

I will continue to develop this until it's a built-in feature, so that it is available until then. Thanks!<br>

By the way, what happened to the email notifications? Why are they off?</div>

I disabled email notifications because I don't like the idea that just about anyone can cause my Web server to send out unlimited amounts of email.</div>
