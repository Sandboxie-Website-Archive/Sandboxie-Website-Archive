<br>
All I'm hoping to do is <em>understand</em> (even for 3.76, whatever) and confirm about all that "extra stuff" I/we talked about that happens otherwise during window creation -- you said it can't be removed, emulates other APIs, etc. and such...<br>
<br>
Quite simply, as I've said, I came to the logical conclusion that "extra stuff" (repeated notification messages, etc.) must be to support drag-and-drop, as that's the only functionality that obviously breaks without the "extra stuff." My thought: What else could it be for? Everything else works fine without "extra stuff."<br>
<br>
<br>
So obviously I'm trying to "get" (or confirm) its purpose, with <em>default settings</em> (e.g. normal configs, NOT about OpenWinClass=#). <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

				<div class="content">As I said a few times, without going into detail, that extra stuff assists in implementing Win32 hooks.  Drag and drop is a different thing and not related.</div>

				<div class="content">OK, thanks for debunking my theory that it was related to drag-and-drop...<br>
<br>
But that makes me more curious and confused! <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> Regarding that extra stuff assisting implementing Win32 hooks, etc. (yeah, I know you said that a few times, but didn't understand), can you point out <em>something</em> I should see that "breaks" when that hook emulation stuff doesn't happen...? <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?:" title="Question"></div>

				<div class="content">I don't have any specific examples, but it should be anything that calls SetWindowsHookEx to place a global hook (in contrast to a hook on a specific thread).</div>
