<br>
sbiextra<br>
======<br>
<br>
I've created a DLL to block sandboxed processes from accessing information about processes running outside the sandbox, and to prevent them from reading the memory of any process not running in their same sandbox. This is accomplished by hooking several API functions:<br>
<br>
- NtOpenProcess<br>
- NtQuerySystemInformation<br>
- NtReadVirtualMemory<br>
- CreateToolhelp32Snapshot<br>
- BlockInput<br>
- InternalGetWindowText<br>
- GetWindowTextA/W<br>
- SendMessageA/W<br>
	&gt; WM_GETTEXT<br>
<br>
The effects of using this DLL on sandboxed processes are as follows:<br>
<br>
- block system-wide enumeration of running processes and threads (includes Toolhelp32 and PSAPI functions)<br>
- block access to unsandboxed processes - cannot open processes, or read their memory<br>
- prevent sandboxed processes from calling the BlockInput function (blocks mouse and keyboard input)<br>
- prevent sandboxed processes from reading window titles or control text<br>
<br>
To use it, download the DLL and save it somewhere. Then insert this line in your Sandboxie.ini file under the sandbox you want to use the DLL.<br>
<br>
32-bit platforms:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>InjectDll=C:\some\path\to\sbiextra.dll</code></pre></div>

64-bit platforms add both:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>InjectDll=C:\some\path\to\sbiextra.dll
InjectDll64=C:\some\path\to\sbiextra_x64.dll</code></pre></div>

On x64 platforms, both DLLs and directives should be used.  Sandboxie will inject the proper DLL depending on whether the target process is 32-bit or 64-bit.<br>
<br>
The DLL will be injected into any process running in the sandbox. That's it!<br>
<br>
<br>
Optional INI File:<br>
============<br>
<br>
To control which of the above functions are hooked in a sandboxed process, copy the provided 'sbiextra.ini' file to the same directory as 'sbiextra.dll'.  For each function you want to hook, set the value to 1, for each function you don't want hooked, set the value to 0.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the DLL can output some debug information so you can see some of what is going on.  To output this information, set the value of 'ShowDebugInfo' to 1.  To see the debug output, install and run Dbgview from Sysinternals before starting a sandboxed process.<br>
<br>
<br>
Test Program:<br>
=============<br>
<br>
Also included in the archive is a small test program. First it will attempt a system-wide process snapshot using the Toolhelp32 API, then it will attempt to read 16 bytes from the base address of 'kernel32.dll' from the process whose PID you provide on the command line, and finally it will attempt a process module snapshot of the provided PID using the Toolhelp32 API. To test, run 'injtest.exe' in the sandbox where you're injecting the DLL and provide the PID of a sandboxed or unsandboxed process on the command line. The system snapshot should fail (return a handle of 0xFFFFFFFF). If the target process is unsandboxed, 'injtest.exe' will not be able to read it's memory or take a snapshot. If it is sandboxed, the functions will succeed.<br>
<br>
Next it will take a snapshot of all the windows on the system and try to get their titles via three different methods: InternalGetWindowText, GetWindowTextW, and directly via SendMessageW with the WM_GETTEXT message.  Most of the window titles should remain blank for all three tests.<br>

				<div class="content">Buster, run DbgView with your test.  Do you see my debug output?  It should print lots of information about the function pointers, when the ReadProcessMemory function is intercepted, the enumeration of modules in cmd.exe, and whether the call is blocked or allowed.<br>
<br>
If you don't see anything, then I suspect you're missing the MS VC++ 2008 SP1 runtimes, and the DLL fails to load when injected, or your INI entry is wrong.</div>

Yeah, very probably I donÂ´t have the runtimes.<br>
<br>
Do you know the file names of the required runtimes?<br>
<br>
btw... I donÂ´t receive any error message about missed runtimes. Usually they are showed.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>

LetÂ´s wait until anyone else make a test and comment results.</div>

				<div class="content">You won't get any errors about missing runtimes because the DLL is remotely injected. If it fails, it's up to the loading application (Sandboxie) to notify you.<br>
<br>
You could also check 'injtest' while runing with Process Explorer to see if the DLL is in fact loaded.<br>
<br>
The required runtime is 'msvcr90.dll'.  You need to run the installer to properly install these runtimes.</div>

<br>
You should explain why you created the DLL and whatÂ´s its purpose.<br>
<br>
tzuk: Only one DLL can be injected. At the moment I donÂ´t have the need of loading 2 or more DLLs but maybe it could be a feature request to consider.</div>

				<div class="content">Why did I create it?  I was curious from the post about WoW and the Warden client.  I still hope that guy tests it, cause I wanna know if Warden freaks out.  My other reasons... it was a challenge. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
The purpose is pretty clearly stated.  It blocks sandboxed processes from using the ReadProcessMemory function (search MSDN) to read the memory of unsandboxed processes.  Incidentally it also blocks the EnumProcessModules function (and perhaps others) of PSAPI.dll, since that function internally seems to use ReadProcessMemory.</div>
