				<div class="content">I have a few applications sandboxed that run in fullscreen and changes the desktop resolution. But on exit they won't change it back.<br>
I don't know if they aren't allowed to do that or if they are simply stupid coded and just don't do it.<br>
<br>
But I would like to ask for an option to prevent sandboxed apps from changing desktop resolution.<br>
Additionally an option to prevent fullscreen.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello LoluJaafJofe ,<br>
<br>
Do the applications work fine outside Sandboxie? <br>
Have you tried setting the apps to run in Windowed mode, or changing options via Compatibility Mode?<br>
<br>
If you provide your OS, Antivirus, Sandboxie and Applications versions , I might be able to test them.  <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>

				<div class="content">Some older games do that (I have to download a no cd patch because the DRM is not Windows 10 compatible).<br>
For example Zoo Tycoon. But also legal games from GOG can change the resolution.<br>
<br>
This is annoying because once the resolution changed also all Windows outside of the sandboxed got changed and I don't really know why any sandboxed application should have permision to perform a resolution change outside of sandbox.<br>
There should be an option or a way to prevent sandboxed appliations from doing so.<br>
<br>
But it should be easily to reproduce. All you need is to download any software that changes the resolution whether a game or a software it doesn't matter. Run it sandboxed and let it change the resolution.</div>

				<div class="content">Another reason is that when the sandnboxed application crashes it also does not reset the resolution.</div>

<br>
The devs have provided the following information:  <br>
"This is by design. There is only 1 screen res. at a time. If screen res. is blocked, then most games will not work in sandbox."<br>

Hello LoluJaafJofe,<br>
<br>
If the application crashes outside Sandboxie, does the resolution change ?  What is the exact behavior on the host ? <br>
If you provide your OS, Antivirus, Sandboxie and name of the applications  that crash , I will test them. <br>
<br>
Did you try changing the settings as I suggested before? Right-click on the program --&gt; Properties ---&gt; Compatibility<br>
<br>
