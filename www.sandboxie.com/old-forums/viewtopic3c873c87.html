				<div class="content">Hey guys, what' up. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>
I've been playing around a bit with Sandboxie now. I liked it and decided to try to use it to run a virus/trojan I got a couple of days ago while unprotected. So I downloaded it while in sandboxed mode, and clicked the .exe. I then immediately got a "Messages from Sandboxie" popup window telling me<strong> "SBIE2205 Service not implemented: CredReadA</strong>", and another window named "Sandboxie protected storage saying <strong>"IPStore::GetTypeInfo is not implemented"</strong>.<br>
<br>
I then got an alert from Windows Defender telling me about the trojan, could see the files created by it etc.<br>
<br>
Well, I thought I had cleaned my computer from this trojan some days ago and I will inspect the behaviour of it closer, but my biggest concern is, does those messages from Sandboxie have anything to do with sending my IP and/or credit card number information (Which I doubt I have stored anywhere on my computer though since I almost always pay with one-time-use generated credit cards online)?<br>
<br>
I know I am safe while using Sandboxie, it's what possibly happened a couple of days ago I feel paranoid about.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance!</div>

				<div class="content">"Cred" in the message refers to Windows credentials, not to credit card.  I've revised the page about message SBIE2205 to explain this in more detail.<br>

<br>
Bottom line is, don't worry about this.</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you, I really appreciate it.<br>
I guess that means I should probably change my passwords though if those actions have been run outside of sandboxie?</div>
