				<div class="content">I would like to say thanks for this version 4.01. <br>
Although it is in beta status, it seems to me quite stable. <br>
But I'm talking from a general perspective, I mean I didn't test with nasty websites or files. <br>
<br>
I am glad that the "experimental 64 bit" option is gone. No more restarts when it is enabled for the first time. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"><br>
I have as OS Windows 7 64-bit and I'm NOT going to change to windows 8, unless I really have to. <br>
But still I like the new approach you have taken with the new major version. <br>
Thanks for such a great piece of software ! <br>
<br>
Currently running comodo dragon inside it with drop rights enabled and I see no errors and the browser is responsive as always. <br>
I don't have a LUA or SUA account, I'm always logged in as admin <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> <br>
But I have other security programs running as well, firewall, hips and AV, behavorial blockers. <br>
Nothing is as comforting as a sandbox, makes me feel more safe than using only other security products. <br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks and cheers !<br>
<br>
(edit: not to brag or kiss *** or anything, but I did buy the lifetime license for sandboxie)</div>

Buster, I'm not sure I understand the question.  In a general sense, there aren't any differences.</div>

<br>
If I understood fine, in version 4.xx the "Experimental Protection" is not available, so that difference between 32-bit and 64-bit version is gone.<br>
<br>
Is there any other difference still present between 32-bit and 64-bit version in 4.xx?</div>

				<div class="content">Just purchased the lifetime license.  I really like the product.  Thank you for such a fine program.  I'm using the 4.01 beta.  I have to say for a beta it runs great.  It's running on (1) XPsp3, (1) win7 32-bit, and (1) win8 64-bit.  Haven't run into any bugs yet.</div>

You mean in terms of security? I'm interested in that too. Sandboxie 3.xx 64-bit security was inferior to the 32-bit version without the experimental protection enabled. How is it with that in Sandboxie 4.xx? Are both, 32-bit and 64-bit versions totally equal in terms of strength of security?</div>

				<div class="content">As I said, in a general sense, there isn't any difference between version 3 and version 4, or between 32-bit and 64-bit.  "In a general sense" I mean that regardless of implementation details between various systems -- for example whether this is a 32-bit XP with version 3 or a 64-bit Windows 8 with version 4 -- Sandboxie offers the same level of protection.<br>
<br>
The only exception to the above is that version 3 required Experimental Protection to enable some protection features.  This is no longer necessary in version 4 as 64-bit Sandboxie offers all protection features "out of the box".</div>

So in version 4 it's as if the Experimental Protection is always enabled? I'm happy.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>

Sounds like some incredible work that you've done there tzuk.  I think Ilya from DefenseWall will be very interested to know how you've done that!</div>

What is the meaning of the refrence to DefenseWall? Are they competing with Sandboxie?</div>

				<div class="content">I observed that in Process Explorer, for example, there doesn't appear to be ANY indication or difference (Security tab, etc.) between processes whose Admin rights are:<br>
<br>
1) Fully intact<br>
2) Stripped by Drop Rights<br>
3) Stripped by SRP (on XP(/Vista?))<br>
<br>
With SBIE 3.x, it was easy on the Security tab... (Although there should really only be 2 distinct states (YES or NO), with no difference between Drop Rights vs SRP.)<br>
<br>
Is there any way to check or determine that information <em>externally</em> now? Is Sandboxie checking some other standard "thing" (token, etc.?) internally; or, more likely, keeping track of stuff itself? <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"></div>

				<div class="content">You can run Process Explorer itself under Sandboxie to see the security permissions that are in effect for the process.<br>
<br>
In version 4, sandboxed processes run with untrusted security so they can't do anything without the help of Sandboxie.  When you use Process Explorer outside the sandbox, all you're going to see is a security context which denies access to anything and everything.</div>

No.  I give direct access to documents, downloads, pics, music.  Then I force them to open sandboxed.  That way anything that was downloaded or saved is forced into a sandbox.  Works perfectly fine on 3.76.</div>
