				<div class="content">I'm really big on freeware.  But there are a handful of programs that I consider are simply so valuable and essential that I must have them and support the development.  Sandboxie is without a doubt one of these programs in my core set, and it's not only the application, but the dedication and support of the developer, Ronen Tzur.  There's a lot of big name players coming into this field, but being a programmer myself, I know that means VERY LITTLE as to the quality of their applications.  Ronen has been developing Sandboxie for a long time, and has been able to refine it with a deep understanding of all the little details that is simply impossible for other company's to duplicate no matter how much money they throw at it.<br>
 <br>
I do have one suggestion.  While I am very happy to have a lifetime of upgrades, I wonder if you could also post some additional donation links on your site that would allow lifetime members such as myself to continue to support you, such as when I install it on a new home computer.  This is just basic marketing...  those who are most willing to give you more money are those who are already satisfied with your product.  Make it easy for us to support you!<br>
