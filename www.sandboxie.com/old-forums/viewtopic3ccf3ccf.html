<br>
I can also confirm problems with Firefox since its latest big update which also changed the installer.<br>
After installing FF into sandbox it displays a blank window with a single New Tab opened, no matter how many tabs I try to open. When I close the browser, however, it reports the correct number of tabs in close multiple tabs confirmation window. No SBIE errors pop up.<br>
<br>
Win 8.1 x64 (up-to-date)<br>
Sandboxie 5.20 x64<br>
Latest Firefox version (installer from the official website)<br>
no other software or AVs installed<br>
<br>
Please, let me know if you need some additional info.<br>
<br>

A few weeks when I tested Firefox 57 for the first time (installing it in a sandbox), I had to do the workaround in order to run it. But yesterday, I installed it again, and this time I have been able to run Firefox out of the sandbox where its installed. I dont know what changed but something has changed.<br>

Hello johndoe2015,<br>
<br>
I installed Firefox in a new Sandbox and tried to launch it, got the blank tabs without being able to use it except for about:config (I tested several combinations with multiprocess and Firefox sandbox but nothing worked).<br>

Hello Barb@Invincea,<br>
<br>
Do you have any news on fixing this issue with Firefox? It is a pretty annoying one. Besides it occurred exactly when I was going to purchase a paid version of Sandboxie so it made me wonder if I should do it at all. I mean, first Sandboxie stopped working with Kaspersky virus protection a couple of years back then, and now I can't even use Firefox, so what's the point? <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> <br>

I re-tested per this post:<br>

and encountered no issues other than having to do a "Refresh Firefox" right after the installation. Please try re-installing Firefox inside a new Sandbox with default settings (make sure to delete the contents of previous Sandboxes that may have Firefox installed in them).<br>
<br>
Also, regarding Kaspersky:<br>

				<h3>Re: Chrome - SBIE2101 Object name not found -(C0000022)</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Wed Oct 18, 2017 4:07 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Scoox</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I'm getting these when I try to install Chrome using the offline installer:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>SBIE2101 Object name not found: , error OpenProcess (C0000022) access=001FFFFF initialized=1<br>
SBIE2101 Object name not found: , error OpenProcess (C0000022) access=001FFFFF initialized=1</div></blockquote>

Installation never completes.<br>
<br>
I then  tried installing into a different sandbox, and it worked, so I created a new sandbox &gt; copy settings from existing sandbox, and copied the settings of the sandbox I had just tested that I knew worked. Named the new sandbox "Chrome". The error happened again. I then created yet another new sandbox, this time copying settings from sandbox "Chrome", but I named it "Chromium". Guess what, it worked. I've done a bunch of experiments and conclude it's something to do with the sandbox name:<br>
<br>
For example, the following sandbox names cause the above errors:<br>
<br>
<em>Chrome<br>
Chrome2<br>
2Chrome</em><br>
<br>
The following sandbox names work fine:<br>
<br>
<em>Chromium<br>
GoogleChrome</em><br>
<br>
It's really strange.</div>
