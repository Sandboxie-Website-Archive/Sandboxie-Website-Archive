				<div class="content">Thanks.  I can also confirm Win XP 32-bit and Win 7 64-bit have no problems directly installing Chrome and Firefox browsers into SBIE.  However, while running, Chrome 64-bit pops up with some errors sometimes (not sure if this happens regardless of whether it's installed directly into SBIE or not).  With Chrome 32-bit, I don't notice any performance detriment and it runs very smooth.  I'd recommend all users to install Chrome 32-bit at this time, not 64-bit.</div>

Thanks! The Devs know that Chrome can be a little picky about installing in a SB. It's picky outside the SB as well, so what you describe isn't out of the ordinary.</div>

All smooth as silk in my Windows XP for years (32-bit OS, 32-bit Chrome).  Smooth as silk so far in my Windows 7 (64-bit OS, 32-bit Chrome).  However, Windows 7 (64-bit OS, 64-bit Chrome) spat out some errors quite quickly.</div>

				<div class="content">I only ran into errors in 10. I did notice, when using FF to download chrome, that time FF prompted me with a small "allow Googleupdater.exe" to run? If that was missed, Chrome and SBIE failed. But if ticked, it worked. I saw it in 7, 8.1.<br>
<br>
At least for Chrome in Win 10, it's best to have that installed on your host, then run "as Sandboxed."</div>

				<div class="content">To clarify, I had no problems installing directly into sandbox.  Only issue was running Chrome 64-bit within the sandbox <em>thereafter</em>.  A few errors popped up on exiting Chrome at times.  Can't remember details now, as I'm happy with 32-bit.</div>

Thanks for the clarification. The good thing ( I guess) is that chrome will install 32 bit by default on your 64 bit OS unless you really have the 64 bit urge and Go get it.</div>

				<div class="content">As an alternate in Win10, I downloaded portable chrome from portableapps.com, within the sandbox. This worked OK. <br>
<br>
The only issue I've found thusfar with installing browsers into the sandbox vs on the host (I try to install as little as possible on the host), I haven't figured out yet how to associate the http protocol and default web browser to the browser installed inside the sandbox. I've also run into the graphical glitch in both chrome and firefox where the title bars/tabs for the browsers don't fully fill out the box and leave a few extra ugly pixels the color of your window highlight.</div>

kawaiiwolf, an easy way to run browsers that you install in the sandbox is to create shortcuts via Sandboxie UI.<br>
<br>
Sandboxie control&gt;Configure&gt;Windows shell integration, Click Add shortcuts, Select the sandbox where you installed the browser, find the browser in one of the menus, Click it, and you ll find the shortcut at the desktop.<br>

Ohh, that's a much easier way to do it. I've been creating shortcuts manually by pointing to <div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>"C:\Program Files\Sandboxie\Start.exe" /box:Steam "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe"</code></pre></div> for example. This however is not the problem I'm speaking of; if you go through Settings &gt; System &gt; Default apps OR Control Panel &gt; Default Programs &gt; Set Associations, you can't change the protocols for HTTP/HTTPS for example to something installed within a sandbox.<br>
<br>
This has lead to an amusing side effect for me. Sandboxie (thankfully) denies edge and tries to open up http requests using iexplore. I have removed this from my system however, so random links don't open. I see this as desirable since any old app can't just pop open a web browser when they feel it's time I ought to donate or view instructions I didn't ask for. While it also means it can be difficult to get to some pages that only utilize this method, it tends to do me more good than harm =)</div>
