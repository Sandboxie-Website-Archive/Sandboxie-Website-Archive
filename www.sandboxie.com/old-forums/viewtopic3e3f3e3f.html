When opening a PDF that is attached to an email, will Adobe Read be sandboxed? Should I see a yellow box around the PDF like I do when running windows explorer?</div>

				<div class="content">Greetings AV-3900,<br>
<br>
Are you running your email reader Sandboxed? <br>
Please provide a little more info so that we can assist:<br>
OS version, Email reader that you are using, SBIE version.<br>
<br>
If you are concerned about pdf files only, you can set Sandboxie (paid version) to force Adobe to launch Sandboxed:<br>

If your browser is running sandboxed, or Adobe is forced, then yes.</div>

Hi, AV-3900.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
About the PDF that is attached to an email, if you are using web mail, as long as the browser is running sandboxed, the PDF or any other attachment that you run, will run sandboxed.<br>
<br>
Same thing happens if you are using an email client and its running sandboxed.<br>
<br>
You can also force your PDF reader to make it run sandboxed automatically every time a PDF runs by using the Forced programs feature that gets unlocked in Sandboxies paid version.  Read the link posted by Barb.<br>

				<div class="content">Sorry, I should have posted more info to start with.<br>
<br>
OS is Win 7<br>
<br>
I should have the most recent version of SBIE, when I checked yesterday, it said there were no updates. Yes, paid version.<br>
<br>
Outlook is email reader. At the moment, NOT in a sandbox.<br>
<br>
I have Dell Protected Workspace on my work computer, which is basically Sandboxie, correct.....? At work when I click on PDF, in an email, the PDF has Red border around it just like when I open a browser. When I preform that same task on my laptop, that has SBIE, there is not border around the PDF.</div>

The colored border is not set to appear by default. You can change the setting in Sandbox settings&gt;Appearance.<br>
