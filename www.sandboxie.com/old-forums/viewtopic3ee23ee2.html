				<h3>Sandboxie SBIE2203/SBIE2205 Errors</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Tue Aug 13, 2013 2:49 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Sandboxie Version: 4.04 x63<br>
<br>
Windows Version: Windows 7 Ultimate x64 (Up To Date)<br>
<br>
I've just performed a fresh installation of windows, after installing all the latest updates I installed sandboxie and other third party software (CCleaner, Palemoon, etc.) and then when I went to create a sandbox for palemoon I got an error while launching it in the sandbox (Using default sandbox settings).<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>SBIE2205 Service not implemented:  Win32Init.5 (00000005)<br>
SBIE2205 Service not implemented:  Win32Init.5 (00000005)<br>
SBIE2205 Service not implemented:  Win32Init.5 (00000005)<br>
SBIE2203 Failed to communicate with Sandboxie Service:  *GUIPROXY_00000001 - SandboxieRpcSs.exe [FF000005]
</div></blockquote>

Any assistance in the matter would be greatly appreciated, I looked at the help links for both errors but was unable to find any solution.<br>
<br>
Here's the direct links if that helps.<br>

				<div class="content">Unistalled 4.04 and Installed the latest beta 4.05.05 (64-bit) from the link you gave me. This doesn't seem to have fixed the error however and I am currently unable to run anything sandboxed (Even in the DefaultBox) without the aforementioned error messages.<br>
<br>
I removed SBIE completely restarted and reinstalled 4.05.05 and everything is working fine now.<br>
<br>
Thanks.</div>

				<div class="content">I have seen many SBIE2203 error messages on my notebook with version 4. I was using 4.05.05 and when I opened a pdf link in my browser, many SBIE2203 error messages would show up, I closed the box and they would pop out again.<br>
<br>
Uninstalled and installed version 3.76 and on the same pdf link in the browser, no SBIE2203 error message. Perfect....and also surprised why version 4 did not perform as well.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?:" title="Question"></div>

I'll do that this weekend (I might even just re-do windows again and check as I install each program) don't sweat not being able to find the issue sometimes tech will do that <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>

				<h3>SBIE2203 Failed to communicate with Microsoft Skydrive</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Wed Sep 04, 2013 12:55 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Whenever I edit (in Microsoft Office 2010) files from Skydrive and then try to save them I get:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>SBIE2203 Failed to communicate with Sandboxie Service:  *GUIPROXY_00000000 - MSOSYNC.EXE [FF000005]</div></blockquote>
The saving still works though! What a relief...<br>
<br>
It happened to me with Sandboxie 4.05.08 (originally 4.0.4) in Windows XP SP3 32-bit.</div>

If you say everything seems to work then I suggest hiding this message.  You can click HIDE<br>
the next time the error message appears.</div>

If it's a third party software, how come it still (thankfully!) saves the files anyway?</div>
