				<div class="content">Hi there,<br>
The problem still exists with version 4.01.09, in my case opening Chrome. It doesn't happen at every attempt to start Chrome, but sometimes Chrome fails to start altogether. Drop Rights was unchecked. Error messages from SB:<br>
<br>
SBIE2335 Initialization failed for process Start.exe [55/8]<br>
SBIE2337 Failed to start program [55/1067][/img]</div>

				<div class="content">Some of the recent posts here quote error numbers that are a bit different than what was posted at the top of the topic.  I.e. error 1067 rather than 5 in message SBIE2337.  I understand those of you getting error 1067 see this regardless of Drop Rights, is this correct?  Did this start with version 4.01.08 ?</div>

The 1067 is just a follow up which shows up around 5-10 seconds later after some 8s.</div>

				<div class="content">I too am still having the same errors but they seem to happening a lot less often.<br>
For me they started after the last lot of Windows updates - I think I was already on .08 at the time.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm sorry to say that I don't really have an idea where to start looking at this problem.  The error 5 before I was able to trigger and then look at what to fix, but I don't know how to trigger this error 1067.<br>
<br>
On the chance that it has something to do with your Sandboxie settings, can you please try to create a new sandbox (with default settings) to see if it makes a difference?</div>

				<div class="content">I began getting numerous error messages RE Sandboxie start.exe, chrome.exe, firefox.exe, flash, etc. after the May Windows monthly updates (Windows 8/64). I eventually restored my system to a pre-update condition and all was well again. I began reinstalling a few updates at a time and it appears that the culprit is KB2836988(Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 update rollup: May 2013). When I reinstalled this update, the errors began again and after uninstalling, no more errors.</div>

				<div class="content">I created a new Sandbox and the only setting I chnaged from the default was to make CALC.EXE a forced program.<br>
<br>
After about 30 starts/quits I got this:<br>
<br>
SBIE2335 Initialization failed for process SandboxieRpcSs.exe [55 / 8]<br>
SBIE2337 Failed to start program:  [55 / 1067]<br>
SBIE2204 Cannot start sandboxed service RpcSs (1067)<br>
<br>
CALC started. The sandbox contained just CALC.EXE.<br>
<br>
After about 40 starts/quits I got this:<br>
<br>
SBIE2335 Initialization failed for process SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe [55 / 8]<br>
SBIE2313 Could not execute SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe (5)<br>
SBIE2204 Cannot start sandboxed service DcomLaunch (5)<br>
<br>
CALC started. The sanbox contained CALC.EXE, SandboxieRpcSs.exe and SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe<br>
<br>
After about 50 starts/quits I got this:<br>
<br>
SBIE2336 Error in GUI server:  [95 / 00000005]<br>
SBIE2336 Error in GUI server:  [44 / C0000022]<br>
SBIE2335 Initialization failed for process calc.exe [88 / 0]<br>
<br>
CALC didn't start and I got a Windows messagebox saying <br>
"Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."<br>
<br>
The Sandbox was empty.</div>

Thanks! <br>

Just the Office 2013 issues in Win 8 to fix for me and I can go back to my preferred position of everything that comes from the internet opening sandboxed.    <br>
