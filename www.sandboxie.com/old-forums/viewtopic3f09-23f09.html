				<h3>Why can't we have an exclusion list for &quot;Drop Rights&quot;?</h3>

I have the free SB 5.16 on Win 10 Pro, on a 1-user laptop.<br>
<br>
As an experiment, I tried Settings &gt; Restrictions &gt; Drop Rights<br>
<br>
Soon after, I got the message:<br>
<br>
   -   SBIE2214 Request to start service 'bits' was denied due to dropped rights<br>
   -   SBIE2219 Request was issued by program SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe [DefaultBox]<br>
   -   SBIE2220 To permit use of Administrator privileges, please double-click on this message line<br>
<br>
When I double-clicked the line, the message implied that the Drop Rights setting would be disabled.<br>
<br>
To verify this, I closed all running SB progs and restarted each prog. <br>
<br>
I re-opened Settings &gt; Restrictions &gt; Drop Rights<br>
<br>
What I expected to find was that the checkbox was still set, but that SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe had been added to one of the inclusion/exclusion lists.<br>
<br>
In fact the checkbox had been cleared.<br>
<br>
So, it seems that Drop Rights is "all-or-nothing". I'm not a techie, but I would have thought that there are so many useful inclusion/exclusion lists in SB that a blocked program could be added to a list simply by double-clicking on the message line - as shown above. There might be some annoying popups for a few days (or weeks), but that should be a user decision, rather than a developer decision  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":-)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
I would be grateful for some clarification on this.<br>
<br>
BTW:  I've had no problems with SB in the couple of years that I've been using it. So, this is probably just a theoretical exercise   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>

After submitting my OP, I continued experimenting with "Restrictions". <br>
<br>
I haven't had a virus since I started using SB, but I thought I should at least try some of the options instead of being lazy and using the defaults.<br>
<br>
So I added my normal internet-facing programs to the "Start/Run Access" list.<br>
<br>
Since then, two programs have asked for permission to run:  rund1132.exe and dllhost.exe<br>
<br>
I simply double-clicked the message line, and the two EXEs were added to the list.<br>
<br>
So, I'm wondering why we can't do the same thing with "Drop Rights"? We might get some annoying popups for a few days, but I'm sure these would gradually taper off as more programs were added to the list.<br>

Um... I have questions about that one.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"></div>
