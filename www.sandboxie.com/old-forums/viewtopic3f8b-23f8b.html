				<div class="content">Whenever I download a program using one of my sandboxed browsers using IDM, Sandboxie does not sandbox the program.<br>
<br>
Is it because Immediate Recovery is not deactivated?<br>
<br>
I remember in previous versions, that all downloaded programs were automatically sandboxed, and one had to choose what to do with it, run in or outside the sandbox. I guess this has changed?<br>
<br>
Finally, do I need to sandbox IDM as well as the browser I use to sandbox a downloaded program?<br>
<br>
Clarification to these three topics will help me use Sandboxie more effectively. Thanks.</div>

				<div class="content">I referenced the other postings and I am confused by the many workarounds such as disable or remove the IDM extensions, or edit the global settings, etc.<br>
<br>
So to save time,very simply in non-techno speak, I would appreciate it if you could tell me what settings do I need to adjust or make in Sandboxie to make sure that all my downloads are sandboxed using IDM when I am sandboxing a browser. Thanks.<br>
<br>
I disabled immediate recovery, and it seems to sandbox the download but I do not think I am doing this properly.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not all that familiar with IDM though I've heard of it and know it's popular for some strange reason... (I just use the DownloadThemAll addon myself)<br>
<br>
I gave it a quick go in a Win7 x64 VM and *think* to get the behavior you desire you'd want to add IDMan.exe as a forced program [I'd give it a separate box in SBIE] and disable the template for IDM in SBIE under Menu &gt; Configure &gt; Software Compatibility &gt; uncheck Internet Download Manager. I wasn't able to properly test because I was using the free version of SBIE in the VM and couldn't have more than one box running at a time or forced programs but suspect it would do the trick. <br>
/me crosses fingers that it helps<br>
/me also looks at Barb expectantly<br>
<br>
Update: Optionally and perhaps less involved would be using a forced folder method for the download directory but that only works if the downloads always go to the same place....hmm</div>

<br>
As an IDM user I am 99% sure Syrinx's recommendation actually works. Untick Internet Download Manager.<br>
<br>
Btw I always use IDM unsandboxed, that is, compatibility case is not unticked. I see no point doing that. Besides it has a major downside at least for me: if you download a huge file, say 3 or 4 GB, recovering it out of the sandbox will cause too much HDD wear.</div>

				<div class="content">Tried unticking the compatibility setting for IDM, and it did not help.<br>
<br>
If I am reading the other postings correctly, IDM acts as an outsider to the sandboxed browser which defeats the purpose of total browser and related programs being sandboxed.<br>
<br>
That being said, to keep browser security tight, I decided to try using in-browser download extensions to help with downloads. This should do the trick.<br>
<br>
What happens in the browser, stays in the browser unless I allow it.</div>
