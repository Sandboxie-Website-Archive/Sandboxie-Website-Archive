				<div class="content">I started using this 3 months ago, after I cured a problem with an IE home-page hijack.<br>
<br>
I now use Sandboxie as a precaution, and scan everything I download with AVG before I recover it.<br>
<br>
This is a brilliant idea. And with 5.2, it got better, since Winamp and Quicktime works.<br>
<br>
I will register this... just need to earn some money first <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";-)" title="Wink"><br>

Dare I say this, but... open source?</div>

				<h3>SB cought 3 Trojans</h3>

				<div class="content"><img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":o" title="Surprised"> I was online and using IE7 when I got three Trojans into the sandbox. They had no effect on the hard drive and were wiped out completely when I deleted the contents of the sandbox. That was the test that meant the most to me. I'm definitely going to pay for this thing. I donâ€™t know how I got along with out it. I use Norton Internet Security and AVG together at the same time. They work and play well together and are a nice compliment to Sandboxie. I feel a lot safer now.</div>
