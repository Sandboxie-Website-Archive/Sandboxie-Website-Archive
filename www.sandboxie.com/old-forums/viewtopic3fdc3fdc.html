				<div class="content">FYI, this fixed a Windows 10 installation problem I was having.  The latest stable release would download and install properly up to the last step (the driver).  That threw an error which I simply accepted.  Afterwards the main control window would not open, saying "user unknown; config won't be saved" etc.<br>
<br>
This v4.19.4 beta installed fine all the way through and in limited testing seems normal.<br>
<br>
Thanks</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Curt, something that's working differently with 4.19.4 is Hiding the 2314 SBIE message. Before, with 4.19.3, the settings below took care of all SBIE messages when running Foxit sandboxed.<br>
<br>
SbieCtrl_HideMessage=2314,FoxitReaderUpdater.exe<br>
SbieCtrl_HideMessage=1308,FoxitReaderUpdater.exe [Foxit] *<br>
<br>
Now, every time I run a PDF, I get a new SBIE message 2314 with a different code at the end. The code changes every time I run a PDF. So, despite hiding the message, the next time I open another PDF, I get another 2314 message with a different code. Like the ones below.<br>
<br>
SbieCtrl_HideMessage=2314,FoxitReaderUpdater.exe [5640 / 0]<br>
SbieCtrl_HideMessage=2314,FoxitReaderUpdater.exe [3292 / 0]<br>
SbieCtrl_HideMessage=2314,FoxitReaderUpdater.exe [4684 / 0]<br>
SbieCtrl_HideMessage=2314,FoxitReaderUpdater.exe [4592 / 0]<br>
<br>
Other than not being able to hide the message for good, Foxit is working properly under this version (as in the past). I am using Foxit portable and this is in my W7 32 bits laptop.<br>

				<div class="content">Bo, we're trying to add more detail to the SBIE2314 to find out why some processes are terminating, so we added [PID / reason code].  Reason code = 0 means that the process never really started.  Most likely due to a DLL being blocked.  So for reason code = 0, I will change it so the PID and reason are not part of the error message, so hiding it will work as before.  Thanks for letting us know.  Are you getting any other reason codes besides 0?</div>

True, whats strange is it actually worked once or twice where a few programs started sandboxed but then degraded and now I can get nothing to start in it and it just loops that message....<br>
<br>
Edit - seems like sometimes it will work most of the time it doesn't probably some kind of race condition.<br>
Edit2 - I noticed it is spawning two SbieSvc.exe processes (not sure if that's normal)<br>
SbieSvc.exe<br>
 - SbieCtrl.exe<br>
 - SbieSvc,exe<br>
^if I kill this sbieSvc.exe then run something in the sb it will work 40% of the time, then the service re-spawns and have to repeat.<br>
<br>
oh yeah the separate 64bit installer also creates wrong shortcuts in the sendto menu where it points to the Program Files (x86) - non existent sandboxie folder (it should point to :\Program Files\ - this doesn't seem to effect the all in one installer though, either that or something is really buggered with the os <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> - non the less tiny bug - <br>
<br>
oh well looking forward to more builds.</div>

Yes, nothing directly tied to Windows 10. This is something we are still working on.</div>
