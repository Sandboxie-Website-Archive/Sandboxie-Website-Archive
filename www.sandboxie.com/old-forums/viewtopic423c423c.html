				<div class="content">The easiest way to get access to a sandbox's registry entries is while the sandbox is active (i.e. programs are running within it).<br>
<br>
Depending on your needs, you've got two quick options:<br>
<br>
1. If you want to view/save the sandbox's registry working set, while an application is running in the sandbox, run regedit (the Registry Editor) and then explore the registry tree HKEY_USERS\Sandbox_[your_username]_[sandbox_name]<br>
<br>
2. If you want to view/save registry entries as if they'd be part of the whole OS registry, then run regedit.exe under the sandbox you want to analyze. If you're exporting, you can use these registry entries later by loading them under the same sandbox, or a different one if need arises.</div>

Buster Sandbox Analyzer has a feature to convert SandboxieÂ´s RegHive file to .REG.</div>

As Buster said, using his tool, or if you do not always have it available, do what I said before:
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1. If you want to view/save the sandbox's registry working set, while an application is running in the sandbox, run regedit (the Registry Editor) and then explore the registry tree <strong>HKEY_USERS</strong>\Sandbox_<span style="color: red">[your_username]</span>_<span style="color: red">[sandbox_name]</span> </div></blockquote></div>

				<div class="content">If it's only a few keys you can find them and export them within regedit either by mounting the reghive file or finding it while the sandbox in question is active. So let's say you have something that creates a 'GAME' key under software. You export the entire 'Game' key, then edit it with notepad to search/replace the entry eg "HKEY_USERS\Sandbox_XXXX_XXXXX_XXXXXX\machine\software" to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software" etc. Once the exported .reg has replaced those values (assuming you get the paths correct) you can then just save it [might want to save to a new file in case you get it wrong at first] and double click to import into the actual registry. That example is actually the reverse of how I normally place games I install on my gaming OS into the Steam\Origin Boxes on my other OS with SBIE where I mount the reghive first then import the altered original export into the box.</div>
