It would be cool if SB can run inside ReactOS.   It uses so little resources too (so may even be more efficient than my XP VM and it will continue to be developed hopefully).    Right now, ReactOS is really just good to run in a VM, but they are trying to branch out to actually physical platforms.    Anyway, just curious.   If it's not yet compatible, maybe one day it will since sooner or later, I need to replace my Sandbox (XP VM) with another and would like to continue to use Sandboxie within my VM (in essence, double-sandboxed).    <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Accordingly, support for Win32 programs is provided through WINE</div></blockquote>

WINE doesn't allow driver installation (much like SBIE) and this is one reason SBIE will not work with WINE in Linux.<br>
<br>
And think about it...you're running a VM (basically)...then a Version of Windows (ReactOS)  that's running an emulator (WINE for Win32 apps) and then you're trying to install a sandboxed container program?</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah; just wishful thinking on my part.   Would be cool if SBIE would work in Linux, then I wouldn't have to worry about what my next VM will be (since Win7 really took a lot of resources so went back to my XP VM).    Ubuntu doesn't take much more resources than XP and the VM that I run is a 64-bit OS of Ubuntu.   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

I saw an announcement from Wine a month or so ago announcing SBIE support....on Linux. I was very curious...and it didn't work. but I was intrigued. I let the Dev's over at Wine know. Not sure how well they tested. yes, SBIE will install, but it won't run.....</div>

				<div class="content">That means the WINE developers are looking into this then.   Interesting.   I've been using SBIE for years now; pretty much the only defense I depend on for my Sandbox now, Craig (use privoxy, and a few other things too, but no anti-virus program).   Only thing I worry about are keyloggers, but I mitigate that threat by deleting my sandbox often.    I like running multiple instances of Iron (Chromium browser variant) for various tasks (banking, email, etc).    Also, I like the idea of being double-sandboxed.    Pretty much no way to depend on any protection scheme, especially anti-virus programs.   SBIE is the closest way to perfection when it comes to protection that I've run across.   No long in the PC repair business, but I've seen more than enough horror stories from customer's PCs to know that no Anti-virus can be trusted; it may help on the occasion phews (wiping the sweat now), but 9 times out of 10, you will be sorry.    I've yet seen SBIE fail me.   A few years back, when I visited Media Militia's website (do down load graphics; I do computer art as a hobby and they have some pretty cool graphics that are free to use), that site was infected and you would get a drive by just by visiting that site.   It took months before they patched that site.   I just deleted the SBIE session and all was well.     I'm pretty sure most other anti-virus would probably have had a conniption with this drive by attack.    Anyway, appreciate the words, Craig.    I've not installed SBIE in Win10 yet and there's little reason for me to do so since I only use it for my VM.    Glad it still works for XP.    <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>
