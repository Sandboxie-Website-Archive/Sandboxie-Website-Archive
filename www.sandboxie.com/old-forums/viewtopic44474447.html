				<h3>Upgrade Error: &quot;Cannot create or update sandboxie program files&quot;</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
In anticipation of upcoming Windows updates, I tried to update Sandboxie to version 5.22 today. <br>
<br>
1. I looked for a new version through the Sandboxie Software. I let it download the new version and install it that way.<br>
2. I selected "Upgrade" for the installation, I did not uninstall.<br>
3. The installation process failed with the error "cannot create or update sandboxie program files". It got hung up on a LICENSE.TXT file, then would throw the error. Attempts to reinstall had the same problem.<br>
4. I checked to ensure that both the Sandboxie Control panel and the Sandboxie Service were not running. They were not. Attempting to manually stop those programs with taskkill from the command line returned errors that those programs were not running. The error still occurred. <br>
5. On reinstallation attempts, I saw an error that would pass by quickly before getting hung up on LICENSE.TXT. It read as follows:<br>
<br>
"Can't Delete registry key 0x80000002 Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall S(The message was cut off at this point)." <br>
<br>
This error would disappear as the progress bar would once again get stuck on LICENSE.TXT.<br>
<br>
6. During one of my repeated reinstallation attempts while trying to Screenshot the above error, the installation returned that it was successful for some reason (?!).<br>
7. Rebooting revealed that Sandboxie appears to be functioning correctly, with my previous settings intact, on version 5.22.<br>
<br>
I am not sure if I should be confident in the installation's integrity, or if this is just a fluke? Any advice would be appreciated.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Barb,<br>
<br>
Thanks, but this just seems to be a link to searching the forums for "LICENSE.TXT"?<br>
<br>
The results are varied and unrelated to my issue.<br>
<br>
Is there a specific workaround or thread I should be looking at? Could you please direct me toward anything that might be more descriptive or instructive?</div>

If Sandboxie is installed and working, check the version to ensure you have the latest beta. <br>
