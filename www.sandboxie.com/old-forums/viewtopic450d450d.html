				<div class="content">Hi there,<br>
<br>
I'm using SB v.5.21.2 x64 on Windows 10 lasted build but somehow I can't connect to this forums "Un/Sanboxed" unless I have my VPN on.<br>
I really don't know where the problem is, every time I try, it timeout saying that the site is unreachable. Please see image below!<br>
Does anyone have any idea what is going on here?<br>

<br>
Are you able to connect to other sites without the VPN?<br>
<a href="index.html" class="postlink">https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/</a>  ---&gt; See if this works.<br>
 <br>
Try flushing your DNS cache and your browser cache and re-test.<br>

				<div class="content">Same. Mobile works fine, and if I hide behind a VPN i can connect on pc as well.<br>
<br>
Without a VPN, the forum is unavailable. Clearing DNS did not work, deleting history did nothing either.<br>
Maybe related to the norton/browser issue (?)<br>
<br>
windows 8.1<br>
latest sandboxie beta<br>
latest norton update</div>

Hello Volcano74,<br>
<br>
Are you able to connect to other sites without the VPN?<br>

Hi there,<br>
<br>
Thanks for the feed! Sorry only today saw your reply.<br>
<br>
I can go to any website without VPN, including  "<a href="../index.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/</a>" <br>
but not to  "<a href="index.html" class="postlink">https://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/</a>".<br>
<br>
It sounds like that the forum is blocked somewhere but I can't find it.<br>
I have even turned off every security to test and nothing.<br>
<br>
Have tested on Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi and Edge.<br>
<br>
Thank you again.</div>

Hi Barb,<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time!<br>
<br>
After my last reply to you, my computer was upgraded to the latest Windows 10 build 16288.1 and to my surprise I am not having the problem, I guess was something that we probably never know exactly what it really was.<br>
<br>
I didn't changed anything besides the OS upgrade itself but, I do like to state that my OS had been upgraded twice before with no changes to the symptom and that was the reason I decided to place my question in the forum.<br>
<br>
If you for the sake of testing still need the private IP address let me know and I will PM you with it.<br>
<br>
For now I think that was for the moment but I will be monitoring it closely and if it happens again I'll let you know for further test.<br>
<br>
Thank you for the insights.</div>

We made some changes in the background, if you send me your public IP address via PM as requested, I should be able to tell you if those changes are responsible for the fix. <br>
