				<div class="content">Have there been any attempts by exploit kits or any other malware to break out of Sandboxie? <br>
<br>
If not, is it because of it's too costly or difficult to break out? Perhaps Sandboxie is not large enough to yet be a problem for malware to spread? <br>
<br>
If yes, is there any additional settings in Sandboxie to give some extra protection? <br>
<br>
I've read the Bromium paper about how they bypassed Sandboxie but that was a few years ago and it was only done for testing purposes.</div>
