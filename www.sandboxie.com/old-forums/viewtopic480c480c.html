				<h3>[Steam] Client is extracting &amp; installing same update every time when I open</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Wed Dec 27, 2017 4:34 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
Before reporting the problem, I warn in advance that the same does not happen with everyone. It varies greatly from system to system and the cause is still unknown.<br>
<br>
What is going on:<br>
<br>
When you start Steam in a sandbox, the process opens and takes 2 to 5 minutes to" extract an package" that already exists outside sandbox.<br>
<br>
(Sandboxed Steam download a new copy of the update that already exists in the non sandboxed file folder.)<br>
<br>
Note: I delete all contents from a box before trying to open Steam client.<br>
<br>
For some reason still unknown, this does not happen with all computers.<br>
<br>
Something that I noticed, is that on computers where Steam opens normally (1~3 seconds) there is no "package" folder inside the sandbox files folder, because Sandboxie uses the original package folder in the original file directory.<br>
<br>
And on computers where Steam opens only after 5 minutes, there is a package folder inside sandbox folder<br>
<br>
There is a fix to avoid this? Is very annoying needs to wait for a download a update that is already in the computer.. as I said, I don't know what is the reason for that.</div>
