<br>
Not sure if this is a stupid question or not so bare with me  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> . <br>

I have a folder on my PC that i want to move into a sandbox so that it only exists within a the sandbox I move it to.<br>
<br>
However when I have tried doing this it either fails or the folder contents get deleted. <br>

<br>
We do not recommend using Sandboxes to store files (however, many users do). <br>
You have to make sure that Auto-Delete is not selected, since as soon as you delete the contents of the Sandbox, the folder will be gone as well.  <br>
Also, make sure other programs aren't deleting the Sandbox contents, for example, CCleaner tends to do that.<br>
<br>
If you can provide more information regarding what exactly are you trying to do, and what are the errors you encounter, we might be able to best assist you.<br>

				<div class="content">bassmastergg, if you get yourself a Sandboxie licence, you could force the folder via Forced folders. Any exe in that folder would run sandboxed automatically if executed by mistake.<br>
<br>
Or, get in the habit of using a sandboxed Windows explorer for navigating to the folder.<br>

				<div class="content">I have a Sandboxie licence and run most things within a sandbox. <br>
<br>
My specific situation is I had downloaded an entire folder into a sandbox from an ftp client. This folder exists within the sandbox. I was working with some of the files within there and had issues interacting with these items via a command prompt etc so I recovered the entire folder to work with it directly. Now after finishing what I was doing I want to essentially "un-recover" the folder back into the sandbox. <br>
<br>
I hope that makes it clearer</div>

Bo's suggestion is the best way to go. The folder has already been recovered, so it is on your host. Moving it to another location won't change much, except that you can easily empty it by deleting the contents of your Sandbox. <br>
<br>
You can move it inside a Sandbox folder if you really want to, just cut it and paste it inside your desired Sandbox (default Sandbox location is C:\Sandbox\Username\SandboxName\) <br>
<br>
If you are encountering a specific issue when trying to move the folder, please provide the full error message and the steps to reproduce it. <br>
