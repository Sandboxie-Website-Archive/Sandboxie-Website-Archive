So, I remember a time, a few years back now, when I could right click a *.jpg file, and could safely view it sandboxied. But whenever I attempt to do the same thing now, I get the following mentioned error message:<br>
<br>
'System Error Code:<br>
<br>
%1 is not a valid Win32 application.<br>
(193)'<br>
<br>
How can I successfully view images within sandboxie?</div>

				<div class="content">It appears you don't have a default image viewer associated with the jpg files. If you would like to use the traditional Windows Photo viewer, take a look here: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/225844/how-to-make-windows-photo-viewer-your-default-image-viewer-on-windows-10/" class="postlink">https://www.howtogeek.com/225844/how-to ... indows-10/</a><br>
<br>
If you prefer to use a different photo viewer that is installed on your computer, then take a look here:<br>

<br>
Once the association is setup then you should be able to right click and select "Run Sandboxed" just like you did in the past.</div>

All is working as expected now. Although I must say that, and for some reason, launching images (i've only tested jpegs thus far) in sandboxie does not work if the associated launcher is Photo Viewer. But it does work fine if the associated viewer is Paint.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not really sure why you can't pull up Photo viewer in a sandbox because Sandboxie doesn't care about what programs are associated. Sorry, I can't help you with that.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Dukeswharf,<br>
<br>
The issue you are experiencing is related to the fact that Sandboxie does not support Windows 10 Metro apps.<br>
<a href="../KnownConflicts.html#Windows%2010" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/KnownConflicts#Windows 10</a><br>
<br>
In order to avoid the problem, you will need to use a different photo viewer (other than the windows 10 one). <br>
<br>
Regards, <br>
Barb.-</div>
