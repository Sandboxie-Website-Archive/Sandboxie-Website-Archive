I was actually just thinking of this, after a discussion with a relative. I have set Sandboxie to this relative, so that it opens the e-mail client program sandboxed, but would like, for example to open IE unsandboxed (other measures are in place to prevent infections), specially when entering a website that requires a login. Sandboxie does prevent keylogging inside (if only XYZ app is allowed to communicate with the Internet and run in the sandbox), but it won't stop whatever is outside, so my relative doesn't feel so comfortable with Sandboxie in such situations, and finds annoying having to copy the link, open IE and paste the link.<br>
<br>
It could be even a good approach, as an option, to exclude IE (in my example) from opening sandboxed if XYZ website is to be entered; that is, to intercept a link (when the user clicks in it) and if, for example, the link matches, say -<a href="../etc" class="postlink">www.sandboxie.com/etc</a>, run unsandboxed. Obviously, only the domain would be read (in this case, -<a href="../index.html" class="postlink">www.sandboxie.com</a>).<br>
<br>
Someone may enhance this suggestion, as well.<br>
<br>

				<div class="content">Temp, your feature has been requested a few times before now, and I know people want to have this option.<br>
<br>
_m00nbl00d_01, I'm afraid that what you suggest means I have to develop and maintain plugins/addons for all major browsers, and I'm afraid that is just too much work.</div>

				<div class="content">As Tzuk said it has been requested before,does that mean it will be implemented in sandboxie in the <br>
(near) future?<br>

If anyone has this problem specifically with uTorrent, here's a workaround. <br>
<br>
First, allow your sandboxed browser to save torrents directly to an unsandboxed location, for example your Downloads folder:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>OpenFilePath=firefox.exe,%UserProfile%\Downloads\*.torrent</code></pre></div>
Then, in your unsandboxed uTorrent, go to Options &gt; Preferences &gt; Directories and set the "Automatically load .torrents from" option. Now, any torrents saved to the Downloads folder will automatically be opened unsandboxed. You can optionally enable "Delete loaded .torrents" to keep your Downloads folder clean.</div>
