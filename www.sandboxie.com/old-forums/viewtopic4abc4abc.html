				<h3>Sandboxie version 1.7 Released</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Fri Mar 04, 2005 12:50 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>tzuk</strong></div>
				<div class="content">In this release:<br>
<br>
- Isolation of windows and window classes on the desktop prevents sandboxed programs from discovering an already-running unsandboxed instance of themselves.  For example, a new sandboxed Firefox window will not discover and join an already-running non-sandboxed Firefox process.<br>
<br>
- Sandboxie Control adds a new action to run any program under the supervision of Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
- Opening or exploring a folder from a sandboxed process will open the folder in a sandboxed window of Internet Explorer, rather than an unsandboxed of the Windows Explorer.  This provides more consistent behavior for sandboxed programs, at the small cost of requiring Internet Explorer to be installed (which should be the case on most systems anyway).<br>
<br>
- Sandboxie will fail access to mailto: links (at least under Internet Explorer), because opening the mail client inside the sandbox (and potentially saving some messages in the sandbox) is probably not what the user intended.<br>
<br>
- Sandboxed processes are denied access to the Service Control Manager.  This means better protection, but, at least as of this release, also means that Windows Installer-based installers will not work within the sandbox.<br>
<br>
- The Working In Background cursor no longer appears when the browser is launched.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug that causes more registry keys to be created in the sandbox than necessary.<br>
<br>
- Sandboxie Control now deletes the registry keys in the sandbox, in addition to deleting disk files, when it empties the sandbox.<br>
<br>
- Sandboxie Toolbar, when used outside the sandbox, warns that navigating to a sandboxed favorite does not mean the browser becomes sandboxed itself.<br>
<br>
- On system startup, Sandboxie Control waits longer for the system initialization to complete, before announcing it cannot connect to the kernel mode driver.</div>
