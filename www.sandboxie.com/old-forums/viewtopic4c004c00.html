				<h3>Freeze/Snapshot Sandbox Contents</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sat Dec 25, 2010 1:49 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>phoenix</strong></div>
				<div class="content">This feature request would allow a user to Freeze/Snapshot the contents of a sandbox. <br>
<br>
The feature might be visually presented in a similar fashion to the Snapshot feature found in VirtualBox.<br>
<br>
To cut down on snapshot size, an implementation might potentially only version the incremental changes from the previous snapshots.<br>
<br>
Right now, I zip my sandbox and delete/restore before running to simulate this 'snapshot' feature. The idea would be to prevent subsequent changes made in the sandbox from being permanently added to the sandbox.<br>
 <br>
Thoughts?</div>

				<div class="content">I think that's a good idea!<br>
<br>
At time x, I would say: Freeze Sandbox.<br>
<br>
If all programs are finished or I say it explicitly, the sandbox is reset to the freeze-state.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't think tzuk would add this feature, it's too much work for too little gain. I don't know many people who would find any use in this feature.<br>
Besides as far as I know, it isn't even possible to "freeze" just one app, you have to "freeze" the entire computer, as every bit of RAM needs to be saved to disk, not just one section of RAM.<br>
<br>
Correct me if I'm wrong though. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>

				<div class="content">Actually to be honest in regards to making a image of the sandbox... A good old fashion xcopy batch file works great been using that with some of the great 3rd party tools on this site and I can make almost like a system restore type of implementation..<br>
<br>
But right now I'm using "SaveGame Profiler" if you use it correctly you can actually do what you want and it manages things for you.<br>
<br>
It's surprising that some softwares that are made for something can be used for something else.<br>
<br>
And with some of the 3rd party apps we have here I can shrink theses packs I make to go back to a previous state... as I hate so badly to tweak a software and lose the best configurations..<br>
<br>
And with RegHive import to be able to edit the main files (As sandboxie uses the same structure) I am also able to control what the softwares see... which in my book is amazing security.<br>
<br>
P.S: Best money I've ever spent was getting the Full Version of Sandboxie.<br>

				<div class="content">Hi Tzuk I was away for the past 3 weeks.. I'll write something up with detailed instructions to share with everyone that wants to be able to have a goback feature with sandboxie.. it's a simple batch file for me to build.. I'll just make sure that it's XP, Vista and Windows 7 Compatible.<br>

				<div class="content">Shawn does your implementation guarantee that installed programs work without problems in their cloned sandbox?<br>
<br>
Actually this might be really useful for using multiple copies of an executable configured in a specific way; ie running multiple copies of chrome running with a specific security/settings configuration than the instance installed on the OS.<br>
<br>
If it indeed does work, then Tzuk, can you please add this under contributed utilities with the .bat file and instructions listed as a tutorial under Contributed Utilities?<br>
 Maybe have a settings page dedicated to this optional function, where it would be activated if the extension is downloaded from here. Kinda like how you have to setup Secure Delete from the settings page too. This also helps in the process of making portable apps IMHO.</div>

That wouldn't be right since I'd be taking credit for his work, so its best that you two decide what to do whenever it finsihed. It was merely a suggestion on my part.</div>
