The problem in notepad SaveAs appears to be a bug in duser.dll.  It is complaining of reentrancy.  It is very low priority because all it does is cause an error msg to be displayed by Sbie.  Notepad keeps running.  And how many people are going to be testing notepad under BSA anyway?<br>
<br>
Firefox was starting werfault.exe for me, but you say it is running fine for you.  So what problems remain?</div>

For me applications using SaveAs crashes. Example: MKVToolNix<br>
<br>
And it is not just me:<br>

Do you want I record a video where you can see it happening? I do not think it is necessary as this problem was reported by other user and I confirm it happens.</div>

As far as I know there are two remaining issues with BSA:<br>
<br>
- The SaveAs dialog crashes.<br>
<br>
Maybe meanwhile a final solution can not be provided you could include a workaround at next beta version and avoid DLL injection to duser.dll. What do you think?<br>
<br>
- Sandboxie returning path to real folder when using NtQueryInformationProcess API. <br>
<br>
This issue is supposed to be fixed in Beta version 4.13.2, right? When is it going to be released?</div>

				<div class="content">I also have problems with Sandboxie 3.76 and BSA 1.88 rev 4 and log_api64.dll from 2014-05-19.<br>
<br>
When running installations (MSI or setup.exe) I get the following error:<br>
"Windows installer service could not be accessed" (error 1603)<br>
<br>
If I only use log_api32.dll the installation starts but gives the error 1603 later in the installation process (registration?) but I dont get the "installer service" error text..<br>
(One example is the installation of Attachmate Reflection Pro 2014 (x64) - Evaluation)<br>
<br>
If I don't use injectdll the installation complete successfully and BSA can do a report, but I miss the API Call Log....<br>
<br>
Just want to give some feedback to the forum. Thanks for the software so far!<br>

You should not have installed software that may interfere with analysis. McAfee would be an example.</div>

Do you anticipate a recommendation of a higher 4+ version anytime in the near future? What's the current reasoning for recommending v3.76?<br>
<br>
(I remember you mentioned it's because of some changes to v4+, but can't remember specifics)</div>
