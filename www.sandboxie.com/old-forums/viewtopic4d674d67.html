				<div class="content">Hi!<br>
<br>
Today in answer to a question I had asked a HitmanPro Technician (Support) replied that if I am using Alert it is no longer needed to use Sandboxie. And his advise was to remove Sandboxie in order to prevent eventual incompatibility problems.<br>
<br>
I answered that would be a big step for me after having used Sandboxie for 10 years. But that I would think about it.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?:" title="Question"></div>

Well, SBIE from the outset was designed to isolate you from potential threats online. That's what it does. And It does that very well.<br>
<br>
That's something Hitman Pro doesn't do. I scans, and scans are never 100%. SBIE is isolated and running in it's own world. So threats have no idea about what's beyond the SB. Now, can there be issues with HM Pro and SBIE? Sure, as well all A/V programs, there may be issues. It just comes down to what you're comfortable with and what you use your PC for.</div>

He is talking about HitmanPro.Alert 3 and not HitmanPro. <br>

<br>
It is not beneficial to ask a company whether you should replace their product with a competitor's. You can't possibly expect Invincea employee's to tell you not to use Sandboxie, especially not in a public setting like this. Further there is little chance the loyal user base of this program will do anything similar.<br>
<br>
My perspective: I have used Sandboxie for a time but have given up on it in favor of HitmanPro.Alert 3. I prefer to stop attacks at the earliest possible stage and not put all my trust in the kevlar. Aside from that I find Alert much more convenient to use. Other people have only used Sandboxie in the past and haven't been infected since. They have no need for Alert. Though for the average home user I am inclined recommend Alert.</div>

After nearly 10 years of utilizing SB daily by default I should be familiar with it by now.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink">  <br>
<br>
The program I'm talking about is not the well known HitmanPro scanner. I've utilized that also for a decade next to SB. This is about HitmanPro Alert 3. It also has the HitmanPro scanner integrated, but does much more than that. Some clips: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hitmanpro+alert+3" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_ ... ro+alert+3</a> <br>
<br>
I've used both SB and that program simultaneously, and had no problems with it. But I'm referring to the advise from HitmanPro's technician to utilize one or the other.<br>
<br>
My apologies if you were referring to HitmanPro Alert.</div>

Thank you too. My machines have only been infected a few times in nearly 10 years. One of them -years ago and the worst case- was when I had gone to Microsoft's Windows Updates website un-sandboxed, thinking that otherwise the updates wouldn't stick on my Windows xp laptop at that time. From there I surfed to another site, forgetting all about not being sandboxed... <br>
<br>
Long story short, even after getting lots of help from an expert on a HiJackThis forum, in the end I had to reformat. (I had just deleted all the backups I had as that system was full, planning to start from scratch again with a system backup a bit later, so I had no backup.)<br>
<br>
Sandboxie must have prevented my laptops from getting infected many times without me even knowing it, and I always felt safe surfing while sandboxed. I realized SB did not prevent someone from looking at the content of my notebooks, strictly speaking, but I never worried much about that slim chance. As long as I would not get infected.<br>
<br>
I still think Sandboxie is very <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool">.</div>

I just found this instruction on how to make Sandboxie and Alert 3 compatible, here, second post:<br>

I had already uninstalled SB, but after reading that I reinstalled. At first SB gave an error message when I tried to open my browser (Opera 12.17) and it did not open. But after following that instruction it does. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

Hi Lode, if it was me, I wouldn't give up or trade my Sandboxie for any program or security setup. In fact, even if there was no paid version of SBIE, I ll take SBIE free instead of any of the security setups that we see at Wilders that doesn't include SBIE. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>

I totally agree, but SBIE and HMPA coexist just fine.  I think where a lot of the problems come in is Chrome.   I'd let Chrome go before any of my security software, especially SBIE<br>

I read a few weeks ago, someone at Wilders call Chrome "Pushy". The pushy browser. That one word describes Chrome perfectly, IMO. To this day, I never had the pushy browser installed in my real system and probably never will. If it comes a day when I cant use NoScript in Firefox, that day I ll switch to IE. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>
<br>
I don't think we need anti exploit programs if we run programs sandboxed. But in a way, for me, NoScript does the role of blocking exploits when doing browsing. I doubt HMPA can do more for security than what I get out of NoScript. As with SBIE, I wouldn't trade using NoScript for nothing/for years of HMPA paid licenses. <br>

@Bo, I'm a fan of your "lean" yet secure idea. SBIE and NoScript. It's worked for me as well.</div>

				<div class="content">I forgot to mention that shortly after my last above post I reported an issue to the Alert 3 team. Now and then Alert 3 would flag a website that was legit as a thread, and automatically closed my Opera 12.17 browser. I suggested they at least make an option available to override that, as I was also in the middle of posting something on another tab, and that was gone too. A bit later they mailed me a link to a beta version they had quickly brought out that solved the issue. Good for them.<br>
<br>
One thing I like about Alert 3 is that it encrypts what you type in an open browser. But then I remembered I still had a lifetime license for SpyShelter. And that it not only encrypts what you type in your browser, but everything you write on your machine, even with no browser open. And to have SpyShelter and Alert 3 both encrypt stuff I was typing seemed overdoing it. So I stuck with Sandboxie and SpyShelter.</div>
