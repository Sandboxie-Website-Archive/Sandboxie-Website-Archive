				<h3>[.02] SBIE 2203 with Crome after upgrade to 4.04</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sun Jul 21, 2013 3:47 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>tomazyk</strong></div>
				<div class="content">OS: Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit<br>
SBIE: upgraded from 3.76 to 4.04 (64 bit)<br>
Other security programs: ESET Nod32 6.0.316 and EMET 3.0 (software compatibility for both programs is enabled)<br>
<br>
The problem started to happen after upgrading from 3.76 to 4.04. I used built-in option to update SBIE.<br>
When I try to download file from internet using sandboxed Chrome I sometimes get mesage: SBIE2203 - Failed to communicate with sandboxie driver. Chrome opens blank "save as" window - I don't see folders to save into - and then the message appears. Sometimes if I wait, "save as" window becomes active again, I can close the message and save the file. Other times I have to close Chrome and try again. <br>
<br>
Thank you for help.</div>

There is a COPY MESSAGES TO CLIPBOARD button when Sandboxie displays message so you can copy and paste them here.</div>

				<div class="content">I've had some reports of this error with Chrome before, and I fixed a few cases that were triggering this error.<br>
And I know a few people are still seeing this error but so far I haven't been able to figure out how to trigger these remaining cases on my end.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you can post a Resource Access Monitor log from Sandboxie for Chrome, and that might offer some hint.<br>
The instructions for that are explained here:<br>

				<div class="content">Thanks.  Unfortunately I don't see anything that looks useful in your log, all the DLLs that your log shows are just standard Chrom and Windows DLLs.<br>
<br>
A couple of follow up questions:<br>
<br>
1.  Please create a new sandbox with default settings and try to run Chrome in this new sandbox.  Does it show the same problem?<br>
<br>
2.  Can you create a precise and very detailed step-by-step of things to do and/or click to show the problem on your end?</div>

				<div class="content">I have created new sandbox with default settings and have tested it. The problem can be reproduced in new sandbox. I think that the frequency of problem happening in new sandbox is lower than in old one, but I can't be sure.<br>
<br>
Here is how I can recreate an error:<br>
1. I start with empty sandbox and run Chrome in it<br>
2. I go to <a href="../index.html" class="postlink">www.sandboxie.com</a> and click on Download link at the top menu.<br>
3. I choose Download from Brothersoft link (other links work too)<br>
4. Brothersoft page loads and when Save As window opens I get the window blank<br>
5. After few seconds I get a message from SBIE<br>
<br>
<img src="../img826.imageshack.us/img826/9489/3e6x.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
6. When I close the message the Save as window is not responsive. I try to close it and get Windows message:<br>
<br>
<img src="../img4.imageshack.us/img4/9076/75pz.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
7. After I close it I get auto-delete confirmation from sandbox for .tmp file:<br>
<br>
<img src="../img543.imageshack.us/img543/9696/6b9e.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
Sometimes after 4), before 5) explorer window becomes responsive and shows my disk locations and I can save a file (although later I still get SBIE messsage). Twice it happened right after I moved my mouse cursor - but that doesn't always help.<br>
<br>
I hope this can help you find the reason for a problem. I can help you with additional testing if needed.</div>

				<div class="content">I did a liitle more testing and I think I found a reason. It all depends on whether Favorites in Explorer are collapsed or expanded.<br>
<br>
I get no errors if I have Favorites folder expanded and get those error as soon as I collapse it. Strange, but I could repeat it many times.</div>

				<div class="content">I'll play with this a bit more but in initial testing it looks like it doesn't matter if I expand/collapse the Favorites folder.<br>
<br>
I thought that unchecking the option "Ask where to save each file before downloading" in Chrome could be a workaround for you, right?  You can download everything to your Downloads folder and let the Sandboxie Immediate Recovery move the file to the final folder.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes I have that option turned on. When I come home from work, I will try disabling it and will see if it removes the problem.<br>
<br>
BTW my default folder to save downloads and for quick recovery is set to "D:\Prenosi" and not to default Downloads folder. Could this be a problem?</div>

				<div class="content">No, I don't think the choice of folder would make any difference here, but if you say the expanded/collapsed state of the favorites folder makes a difference ... Well then anything is possible!</div>

I am getting the same error and when I go into settings, the "Ask where to save each file before downloading" is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"></span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> checked. This problem started for me after my computer restarted following a Constant Guard Protection updated. Constant Guard Version 1.13.506.2 Database 723 (from Xfinity). I need to find a way to reverse the update.<br>
