<br>
<strong>Fixes in 5.07.5</strong><br>

				<div class="content">Haven't noticed any definitive issues yet. I had a random *poof* (CTD without any errors) in a game that didn't have issues under 5.05.3/5.06 but the second round it lasted 45+ mins and hasn't happen again. So likely it's just a coincidence but I'll let you know if a trend starts to show.<br>
<br>
I'm not one of those unlucky souls who had to contend with the race condition issues but it's nice to see you're working hard to solve it, Thanks!</div>

I don't believe Vivaldi is supported by Sandboxie or works under SBIE. I remember trying to test it installing it in a sandbox some months ago and the result was exactly what you said, a blank page gets displayed as the browser opens.<br>

It may be related to Bouncer. A few months back, there was some weirdness when Bouncer was running. I'll poke around. Let me know if it persists, I see that it's intermittent at the moment. Which is good..and bad.</div>

I did test Vivaldi a while back. It I'll give it a test again to see if anything changed. At that time, it worked well. Both directly installed in SBIE and on the host.<br>

There was significant work dedicated to this Beta. Curt, Tom &amp; the Team had a lot of challenges to overcome. It appears, as usual...their work has paid off.<br>
<br>
Feedback from everyone is of the utmost importance. We can test (I can test), We run torture tests, but there is no way to replicate what our users may have, so we value the feedback, suggestions, tips and ideas.<br>

Keep it coming. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>
