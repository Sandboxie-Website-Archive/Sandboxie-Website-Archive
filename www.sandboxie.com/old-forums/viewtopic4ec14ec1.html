Not only that. Even installing Chrome as usual, now in latest beta 5.15.8 is crashing a lot.</div>

We are still looking into this Chrome issue.   We recommend installing Chrome outside SBIE and launching it Sandbox to avoid problems.<br>

				<div class="content">For Chrome 55 installed inside a Sandbox, please try the following: (Same steps can be used for Opera, but you will also have to set the "Sart section" to the Sandboxed location you selected to install it).<br>

Update the target to reflect the following: " --no-sandbox " at the end (no quotation marks) <br>

Update "Start in"  section to reflect the actual installation path (for example C:\Sandbox\User\SboxName\drive\C\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application)<br>

				<div class="content">By the way, this is also related to this: <a href="viewtopic00340034.php?f=11&amp;t=23754" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 11&amp;t=23754</a> - The Steam browser is based on Chromium 55 as well. It has problems launching its child process, just like Chrome. That means both are affected, and every other problem using Chrome 55 as their core web browser.<br>
<br>
For the curious people, this also affects the old Sandboxie version 3.76, so it's not just because of the changes since Sandboxie 4. But of course there is only the hope for an update with the new version.</div>

Unable to get that to work.  Have you actually tried it?  I think adding " --no-sandbox" to the end of that shortcut (which is pointing to a sandboxed Chrome) confuses the address and Windows won't allow it - I can't even add that extra command line in the Target in the first place.  Anyone else have any luck?<br>
<br>
EDIT: okay it can work, but I don't think those steps you've described are accurate?  Unless I'm mis-reading it.  You basically have to add the " --no-sandbox" command to a real shortcut for Chrome.exe within the sandbox.  Then you create a sandboxed Chrome shortcut to this shortcut.  Sounds confusing?  Well, then you probably shouldn't be installing Chrome directly into the sandbox haha.<br>
Running Chrome without its associated sandbox is probably significantly reducing security (despite Sandboxie being excellent).  And the warning also suggests that there could be stability issues.  Doesn't sound ideal, but I'll bite for now haha.</div>

Thanks.  That extra step makes it work well.  And it makes good sense too.</div>

				<div class="content">For Chrome 55 into SBIE there is currently no other way apart from --no-sandbox?<br>
<br>
What are the dangers of installing Chrome locally and then running it with SBIE?<br>
<br>
Would that mean that for updates Chrome would run un-sandboxed during the update and then I can run it locally and with SBIE again?</div>

Currently, if you want to install Chrome inside Sandboxie, you will need to disable its own sandbox.<br>
<br>
You can also install Chrome on your host (we usually recommend doing this instead of installing apps inside SBIE) and run it Sandboxed. <br>
Whenever updates are available, run it un-sandboxed to apply them. <br>
<br>
