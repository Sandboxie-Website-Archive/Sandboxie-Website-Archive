				<h3>Quick-disable Sandbox</h3>

				<div class="content">I'm running some boxes with forced programs, and yes, I know there's this way to "disable forced programs" once with the context menu...<br>
<br>
... but I'd still like to quick disable/enable individual sandboxes that aren't working properly (yet) without having to remove all forced programs from the list or using "disabled forced programs" each and every time. I adore Sandboxie, that's why I bought a couple of licenses, but when in a big hurry I'd just love to be able to skip all potential bugs and wip configs, you know?<br>
<br>
The sane way for this would be to insert a "Disable Sandbox" or "Enable Sandbox" item into the context menu of the boxes, for example below "Remove Sandbox".</div>

<br>
I agree this would be a nice feature. Disabling all sandboxes often feels like overkill when you only need to disable one.<br>
<br>
Not sure if it helps but for speed you can hold ctrl+shift and right click -&gt; run sandboxed. Holding ctrl+shift tells sandboxie to run the program unsandboxed and saves the extra steps of clicking "Run Outside Sandbox" and "Ok".</div>

Interesting; and by-passes the usual warning/confirmation dialogue too.</div>

<br>
So this is why it's all or nothing.<br>
<br>
The warnings and notifications are there for the majority of users that should pay attention to them and don't. Such as the pop ups for software compatibility, then complain that this and that doesn't work, because they clicked through the notifications. If anything, we need more.</div>
