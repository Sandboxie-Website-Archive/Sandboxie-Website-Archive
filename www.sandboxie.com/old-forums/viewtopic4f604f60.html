I realized that what was happening is large files were failing to be moved and the small ones weren't. I think you should increase these limits or at least come up with a better way to explain to the user what is happening. Here's a picture that can be used to reproduce: <a href="../i.imgur.com/acZ669C.png" class="postlink">https://i.imgur.com/acZ669C.png</a></div>

<br>
I was able to attach the picture you posted by resizing it to 100KB<br>
If you need to upload bigger files, you can use a free file hosting website just like you did with the image at the end of your post.<br>
<br>
As for the error messages, I am not seeing a way to change those. If I get a chance, I'll search the phpBB3 forums to see if there's any way to make them easier to spot.<br>
