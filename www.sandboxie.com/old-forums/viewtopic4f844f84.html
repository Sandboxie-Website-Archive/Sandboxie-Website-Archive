1.Paste and Copy not working in sandboxed browsers<br>
2.The Chinese stock App (zd_zszq.exe ), it does not work in Sanboxie.<br>
<br>
Above the problems which should be fixed with the new OpenWinClass=* setting.<br>
<br>
<br>
But I am not sure whether this is the best solution, is there a better solution?<br>
<br>
<br>
Hoping to make Sandboxie better!</div>

the new OpenWinClass=* setting is what will bring about security issues? <br>
<br>
If not, the question 1 and question 3 have been resolved. Only question 2 has not been solved.<br>

				<div class="content">On Windows 8, I can see that Freegate fails to run.  Unfortunately this program cannot be analyzed because it includes counter-measures. Sorry.<br>
<br>
OpenWinClass=* relaxes security to some small extent, as a compromise.  It is still going to be more isolation than running the program outside the sandbox altogether.  But ultimatey it's up to you to decide.</div>

Turn on "Accessibility" feature, within the Sandboxie 3.76 can copy and paste.<br>
<br>
But Sandboxie 4.0X doesn't.It must add the setting of OpenWinClass=*. "OpenWinClass=*" = " turn on "Accessibility" feature"?????<br>
<br>
Sandboxie 4 uses a new protection mechanism.If Sandboxie 4 is to be compatible to run Freegate, It will makes Sandboxie 4 cannot restrict Freegate.</div>

				<div class="content">Accessibility feature is more than OpenWinClass=*.  It also gives full access to the COM subsystem.<br>
 <br>
I don't understand what does this have to do with Freegate on Windows 8?<br>
You can run Freegate on Windows 8 when using OpenWinClass=* ?</div>

No!<br>
<br>
 I can not run Freegate on Windows 8 when using OpenWinClass=* or other setting. On Windows 8 , I can not run Freegate in Sandboxie 4.0 .<br>
<br>
<br>
Sandboxie 4 uses a new protection mechanism. <br>
If Sandboxie 4 is to be compatible to run Freegate, It will makes Sandboxie 4 cannot restrict Freegate ??</div>

Why turn on "Accessibility" feature, within the Sandboxie 4 can not copy and paste.<br>
<br>
<br>
