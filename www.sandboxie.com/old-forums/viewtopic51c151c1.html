Thank you.<br>
<br>
IE is being launched as a Forced Program and results in the failure to start error message.<br>
<br>
Running any "Sandboxie\Start.exe &lt;program name&gt;" command quietly does nothing.</div>

Then if I open AIMP3 (wasapi exclusive: event*) I can hear music playing. When I close aimp, come back to browsers and click play again the sound magically comes back. Dunno which version caused this, it's rare and unreproducible on demand. I've tried older sound drivers.<br>

				<div class="content">Hi SBoxie Friends<br>
<br>
Hey, I'm running W8.1 (64).  Noticed I have a Sandboxie Service (32)<br>
<br>
Do I need the 32/64 bit installer ?  Or is 64 backward compatible.  Or is Sandboxie Service simply pointing to Firefox (32)<br>
<br>
Are beta Installers forward and backward over installers like release installers.  I mean with 4.15.9 Installed.  May I over install with 4.14 if necessary.  <br>
<br>
Running 4.14 lifetime and wanted to see if 4.15.9 was friendlier toward Norton Toolbar and WOT rating does not render to Yahoo search results. Google Yes ~ Yahoo No.   Go figure<br>
<br>
Anyone know time line for 4.16 release</div>

Yeah the 64 bit installer (program) includes a 32 bit sbiesvc.exe and sbiedll.dll for injecting 32 bit programs and communicating with 32 bit programs in the wait for it...(32) folder found within the sandboxie installation directory! Not so sure on you other comments regarding the addons, personally I have yet to experience any issues with addons (firefox or palemoon) perhaps I should have read the last few pages to get that part?......but if you have issues with addons or programs, I'd start the resource access monitor and check what *might* be getting denied for yourself.</div>

Not having "issues" with Firefox and Norton and  v4.14.  Just that I noticed on my Vista 32 box.  Norton Toolbar is fully functional and on my W8.1 64 box.  Norton Toolbar features are degraded with v4.14.   Noticed that WOT and Norton Safe Search rating Icons are hesitant to populate in search results with v4.14 on W8.1 ....while ready and willing and able to render on Vista 32 box.  <br>
<br>
So, v4.14 seems more compatible with Vista 32 than W8.1 64<br>
<br>
So, hoping v4.15.9 aka v4.16 would sort.<br>
<br>
Does this tell you anything ? <br>

<br>
EDIT:  Well, v4.15.9 ~ No obvious change above the hood.  v4.15.9 + W8.1 still not as compatible as Vista with my toys.   All the updates must be under the hood.   I did have one of these &lt; SBIE2327 Error in COM server:  [22 / 5] &gt;   Maybe just settling in Error ?   What's it mean ?<br>
