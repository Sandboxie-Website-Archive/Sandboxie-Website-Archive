				<div class="content">Hi Everyone!  <br>
<br>
I'm newbie here.<br>
<br>
I'm working on a very important project involving a Hotel Management software (Fiesta HMS) which uses CACHE2010 database. We are planning to virtualize our every client stations to NCOMPUTING Device. The problem is that the HMS software we're using is unable to run in a multi user environment. <br>
<br>
Is Sunboxie capable of emulating every station to mimic client to serve like standalone pc? Please help.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not familiar with the product but from the way you described it I would think it very unlikely that Sandboxie is what you are looking for. It does not emulate, make use of a VM or hide what the software is running on. It just isolates the actual system from any changes made by the protected software while it runs inside a box.</div>
