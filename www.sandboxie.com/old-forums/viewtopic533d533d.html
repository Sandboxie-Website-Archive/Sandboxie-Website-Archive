Yes, It's not supported at this time. I should have put 2015/16. That has been noted. <br>
<br>
We have rec'd an email from KS labs about the issue. I'm sent that to the Devs. It'll be looked at.</div>

My apologies, Comodo doesn't work in Win 10 and SBIE. Avira is an A/V product that does work.</div>

Sandboxie &gt;=5.01.7 versions breaks compatibility with Bitdefender products, because of the
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>SBIE2224 Sandboxed program has crashed: SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe
</div></blockquote> error which shows up when any process starts in sandbox.<br>
Workaround is add the following executables:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>sandboxierpcss.exe, sandboxiecomlaunch.exe, start.exe, sbiectrl.exe, sbiesvc.exe</code></pre></div>

Yes, but it all depends on what is needed. If a fix or fixes compromises SBIE, then It may not work. I explained that to KS labs as well. We'll see what it'll take. Unfortunately I don't have any sort of ETA.</div>

@Dun. Look here. This is from July 30 but still, I think its worth noting that BitDefender themselves said that they were not ready for W10. Using BD along SBIE at this time in W10, its probably not a good idea.

Yes, the changelog indicates what was addressed, please check there first..this release only addressed sound in media players and Win 10 update (<a href="viewtopic89e789e7.php?f=53&amp;t=21354&amp;p=110484#p110484" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 84#p110484</a>).

I've found a temporary solution to the "Sandboxie doesn't work if Comodo Firewall/Antivirus is installed on Windows 10" problem.<br>
<br>
First make sure you have the latest version of Sandboxie installed. I've tested using Sandboxie V 5.01.13<br>
<br>
Open Comodo and click Open Advanced Settings.<br>
<br>
Go to Defence+ / HIPS / HIPS Settings. You will see a setting called "Detect shellcode injections". <strong>Make sure it's checked because the solution doesn't work if it's disabled.</strong> (You don't need to have HIPS enabled if you don't want to, just make sure "Detect shellcode injections" is checked).<br>
<br>
Now click on Exclusions. In the window that opens right click and choose Add -&gt; Files.<br>
<br>
Go to the Sandboxie folder located in Program Files or Program Files (x86) and select all the executables you find there<br>
<br>
"Start.exe""License.exe""SandboxieBITS.exe""SandboxieCrypto.exe""SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe""SandboxieRpcSs.exe""SandboxieWUAU.exe""SbieCtrl.exe""SbieIni.exe""SbieSvc.exe"<br>
<br>
Click OK to add them, then click OK in all Comodo windows that are opened.<br>
<br>
Now Sandboxie works  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green">  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green">  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> <br>
<br>
One more thing. I've discovered all this by accident. After the latest update Chrome would crash on start (Google Chrome has stopped working) if Comodo was installed. The solution I've found was to add C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe to the same Exclusions list in Comodo. This had nothing to do with Sandboxie, but it gave me the idea to try and do the same thing with Sandboxie's executables.</div>
