				<h3>Sandboxie Recovery Option</h3>

				<div class="content">I would like to see a feature that allows for when the sandbox is deleted it does not ask if you want to recover the files.  I have sandboxie installed on my parents computers (yes I made them purchase a copy).  I have it set up to where it deletes the box when they exit the webrowser or outlook.  However, sometimes files are downloaded that they didnt know about and sandboxie asks if they want those files.  They are not sure what is going on and they just hit cancel.  So I would like to see a feature that would cause that screen not to come up.</div>

You mean like a "Do not prompt for Quick Recovery if Automatic Deletion is enabled" checkbox?<br>
I'll second that option if it isn't to hard to incorporate. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>

				<div class="content">I guess I just don't understand how that's useful.  Either you want recovery, or you don't.  And if you do want it, then why wouldn't you want it before deletion takes place?  It is the last chance before the stuff is lost for good.</div>

				<div class="content">True, but in my case for example, I have a lot of sandboxes that are temporary or for malware, I'm not concerned with recovering files from those sandboxes, but as it stands Quick Recovery pops up everytime the sandbox is deleted (manually or automatically) and it just feels like an extra step to have to go through. Only removing all Quick Recovery folders actually "disables" the Quick Recovery prompt.<br>
<br>
But either way, it isn't a big deal for me if this is added or not, cause I am not bothered by the Quick Recovery prompt personally. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>

				<div class="content">Then it seems to me that a Remove All button on the Quick Recovery settings page would make more sense.</div>
