				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
today I've encoutered this message a couple of times:<br>
<img src="../shrani.si/f/29/1i/ZvUhNpE/untitled.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
I have Firefox v52.0.1 and Sandboxie v5.16 and Avast AV. I've had this setup for years and those versions for weeks and never ever encountered the message in question. It started appearing today, happened about 5 times in 3 hours, I haven't changed anything today (haven't updated FF, SBIE, AV or any Windws Updates or anything at all).<br>
<br>
I've googled xul.dll and it's supposed to be FF's file. What's it trying to do? I've never had to increase the size limit in SBIE, in over 7 years of use.<br>
<br>
Thanx.</div>

<br>
What's your OS version? Do you have e10s disabled? <br>
<br>
Does the issue happen in a new Sandbox? <br>
<br>

				<div class="content">Hello Barb,<br>
<br>
I'm on Windows 7 64-bit. What is/are "e10s"?<br>
<br>
I haven't tested it in a new sandbox but my DefalutBox always deletes itself after I close all the programs in it.<br>
<br>
Thanx.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Bellzemos. You could reinstall Firefox and delete the Firefox folder in Programs files before reinstalling Firefox. <br>
<br>
How large is your xul.dll file? The file is inside the Firefox folder in Programs files. Mine is just over 50MB. Never gotten the increase size message.<br>
<br>
If Firefox works fine despite the message, you could tick box "Dont issue a message when a file is too large to migrate" (Sandbox settings&gt;File migration).<br>
<br>

				<div class="content">Hello Bellzemos,<br>
<br>
I tried to reproduce the problem, but I was unable to.  I tested a few VMs and host machines, and xul.dll seems to be bout 51 megs for Firefox x86 and around 61 for Firefox x64.   <br>
What's the size of your xul.dll file? <br>
<br>
Bo's suggestions might do the trick , let us know the outcome. <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>

				<div class="content">Hi, all I did then yesterday was upgrade to Firefox v52.0.2 and now I'm not getting the message anymore. My xul.dll is 50 MB in size. Thank you both for help!</div>
