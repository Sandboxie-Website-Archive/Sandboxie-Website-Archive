				<div class="content">Hi there. <br>
<br>
From time to time I have come across applications that I would much prefer to test in a Sandbox as opposed to installing on my actual system.  <br>
<br>
It seems that Sandboxie could help me with in these cases. <br>
<br>
However, since these instances are relatively rare, I'd love a Sandbox program that, if possible (I don't know if this is possible) "loads" only when I open it, and "unloads" completely when I close it. As in, no startup processes, no services that will continue to linger around even after I've closed Sandboxie, etc. <br>
<br>
Could anyone please let me know if I can configure Sandboxie to run services only when started, and unload all services upon being closed?</div>
