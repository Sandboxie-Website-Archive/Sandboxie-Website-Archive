				<div class="content">Just thought I would take a few moments to add my support for SandboxIE to the growing list.  Whilst it is unfortunate that the licensing model has changed, financial viability is crucial in any concern.  So whilst the cost is not trivial, neither is it excessive or indeed unwarranted.<br>
<br>
And with that onto the recommendations.  I have been fortunate enough to have used SandboxIE for a number of years now and during all these years I have only suffered a single malware mishap which was entirely due to my own stupidity.  Throughout this time SanboxIE has performed admirably, providing an additional invaluable level of cover for my PC; so much so in fact that after Windows Updates it is absolutely the first item during a new install.<br>
<br>
Thanks for a great product and great support to back it up.  Oh, and no need to hold back on the Microsoft Edge support on my behalf! I personally give the go-ahead for Edge compatibility to be added to the next release. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing">   Seriously though, the product is exemplary and other software ventures no doubt look enviously upon the growth that has occurred here from back in the Tzuk days up to the current lofty heights with good reason. Long may such halcyon days continue.<br>
<br>
Keep up the good work!   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>

What has changed with the model in your opionion?

Thanks, but it's not that simple. It's not only edge, but the code around that and the metro apps that take a significant amount of work.</div>
