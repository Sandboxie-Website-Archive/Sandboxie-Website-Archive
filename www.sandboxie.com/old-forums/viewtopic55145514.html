				<h3>Sandboxie.com Website Updates / Swag Ideas?</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Fri Oct 02, 2015 9:10 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Hi Everyone,<br>
Well, I've finally been able to do some minor update work on the Sandboxie.com website. Currently, I've updated:<br>
<br>
<strong>~Known Conflicts page <a href="../indexa186.html?KnownConflicts" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?KnownConflicts</a><br>
(This will stay updated as we get more and more info..)</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>~FAQ (Technical Requirements Section) <a href="../index290e.html?FrequentlyAskedQuestions" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?Freq ... dQuestions</a></strong><br>
<br>
The goal is to totally revamp the site. We inherited a good, but now dated site (originally written in June 2004.) Curt and I have some ideas to give some updates to the front page to quickly showcase what SBIE is and what it does well, obviously, if you go there now, that's not so certain.<em> It's a guy sitting on a rock, on a mountain, with a laptop. </em>  <a href="../index.html" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com</a><br>
<br>
With that, we also want update the graphics on many of the web pages, but especially the front page.  (We're<em><strong> not changing</strong></em> the classic SBIE wedge/pizza graphics or programs icons...no need to worry!)<br>
<br>
That will take time, as those have to be vetted.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes"> <br>
<br>
Personally, I'd just like a brand-spanking new and modern site. We shall see.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Update as of 12/2015:</strong></span><strong><br>
Two things:</strong><br>
1.We're getting some "swag" to give out for forum members that help us, help you(bugs, discoveries, being helpful, etc.) Some of you guys already have met that in spades! So.... I need Logo ideas. Of course, no payment would be offered (other than the swag in return) and we (Sandboxie Holdings) would be authorized to use the logo idea without restrictions. So not TM or copyright issues. We're thinking about shirts, etc. But We'd certainly give you props if we ended up using the idea!<br>
<br>
2. Sandboxie Website. Meh. This site uses ancient phpbb code. It's archaic. While I'm doing my best to stumble on pages that need updating or just simply make zero sense anymore, please please feel free to point out anything (statement, page, etc) you may find that I need to fix. It's a collection of cobbled pages since 2004.<br>
<br>
<strong>Known conflicts</strong> page will be updated constantly and the most frequently. The apps listed there will be used to trigger a compatibility box when the GUID is detected during the installation of SBIE to refer the user back to that page.</div>

				<div class="content">IMHO ... not sure a guy sitting on a rock, on a mountain, with a laptop captures all that Sandboxie does. <br>
<br>
Why not show someone or a group of people ... all ages of computer users (some chatting together in casual dress drinking coffee, some meeting in a serious business meeting with suits, some in their sporty leisure clothes ... playing in some sort of 'sand box' area (perhaps in a park that shows skyscrapers on one side and trees on the other?) ... having something like "invisible" barriers surrounding them (a distorted water-like opaque barrier one can kind of see through ... and showing a few 'evil lurkers' just outside the barrier unable to get through ... <br>
<br>
with some key phrases such as ... "Sandboxie keeps you safe from those digital evil doers." ... or, "Wouldn't you rather have a safe way to work and play while online?" ... or ... <br>
<br>
Sorry if that's kind of silly, but that's free-wheeling brainstorming off the top of my head just now.</div>

				<div class="content">Oh, and be sure to have one or two people eating a slice of pepperoni pizza, showing the round pepperonis on the slices.  Corny? <br>
<br>
You could start to make the scene ... inside or outside of the sheltered 'sandbox' area ... have different icons or goings on that have some sort of meaning related to Sandboxie's capabilities ... probably mostly little scenes that show 'protection' ... like icons representing streams of data (virus or malware) in a comic format, unable to enter into the sheltered area or penetrate the opaque barrier surrounding the 'sandbox.'</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah. Have the armored soldier somewhere in the scene, along with the ham on crackers arranged like the SBIE icon. Those are the kinds of fun icons and pictures I'd plant in different areas around the 'sandbox' scene.  <br>
<br>
This makes it 'intelligent', I guess, by having clues or things people notice upon their second or third visit ... or something like the Beatles' Sgt Pepper's album cover, with different relevant pictures? It suggests that there is always something lurking somewhere, but SBIE keeps 'em out.</div>

				<div class="content">I do agree that the sandboxie.com site looks outdated, it should become a bit more flashy, but of course not bloated. Just look at the Zemana and SpyShelter pages for example. The one from Zemana is a bit bloated, the other site loads quicker, and looks more clean, but I don't like the animated pictures:<br>
