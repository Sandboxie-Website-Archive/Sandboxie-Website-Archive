				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Tue Aug 28, 2012 10:28 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Does choosing to preconfigure Sandboxie in the Configure&gt;Software Compatibility section have any influence on programs "Installed IN" a sandbox?<br>
<br>
My understanding is that it does for those programs installed outside of the sandbox.<br>
<br>
I am trying to install Adobe Acrobat "IN" a sandbox and it is not able to load a system driver (SBIE 2103) and I was wondering if just enabling Adobe Acrobat in the Configure&gt;Software Compatibility section would do the  trick, or if I will need to go with help sections advise on allowing "Blocked Drivers" advise.<br>
<br>
Thanks</div>

				<div class="content">Hmmmm, after looking at it I guess that I don't set it there.<br>
<br>
It is in the 'Sandbox Settings&gt;Applications&gt;PDF/Printing' section . . . .<br>
<br>
Basically, the same questions stands.<br>

				<div class="content">As I think on this some . . . and maybe this should be moved to the "Feature Request" section:<br>
<br>
Is it not possible for a program to install drivers ONLY in the sandbox?<br>
<br>
This is where my understanding of how windows, drivers, and program interaction with the OS obviously breaks down -- and is probably a dumb questions.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed"> <br>
<br>
I just thought that that would be a cool feature if the drivers could be loading and installed IN the sandbox only much like all the other program files.<br>
<br>
Please let me know (&amp; excuse this post) if that was a little stupid.<br>
Done lots of tinkering (Windows, Linux, etc, etc) and have a lot of fun with it, but I definitely have large gaps in my understanding of how it all works.<br>

				<div class="content">With Reference to the above post(s)<br>
I have read how to enable an install to Install/Load a driver here:<br>
<a href="../indexecb2.html?BlockDrivers" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?BlockDrivers</a><br>
<br>
With reference to my <em>'LAST POST'</em>, could I not put the entries that are described here ( <a href="../indexecb2.html?BlockDrivers" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?BlockDrivers</a> ) in the "Write File Path" and "Write Key Path" section to isolate the install of drivers, and registry settings to that particular sandbox itself?<br>
<br>
Again, thanks for the help.</div>

				<h3>New info on Acrobat X not loading - Error messages</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Wed Aug 29, 2012 12:12 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>TDPsGM</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I think I might be looking at the wrong thing here.<br>
Here is a copy of the error message that the install throws me when I try to install JUST Acrobat X (version 10.0.0) in my sandbox:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Exit Code: 6<br>

<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div></blockquote>

I was reading in another post where earlier installs were having issues and folks were using the 'Resource Access Monitor" to help figure out what the problem was.  I am still looking at it, but I thought I'd post what the install was saying the error was.  (I just assumed that when it couldn't load the pxhlpa64 system driver that that was the problem).  What I am finding when I try to load JUST the Acrobat X program that i don't get that message, which is why I thought maybe I should post the Error message that the installer is throwing.<br>
<br>
My apologies for the number of posts.<br>
I am trying to work through this on my own by reading through the forum, but there doesn't seem to be much on this issue.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any assistance anyone could provide.</div>
