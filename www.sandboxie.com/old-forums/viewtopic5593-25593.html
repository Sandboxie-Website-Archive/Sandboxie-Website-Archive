				<div class="content">Hi there,<br>
I  get this error message when I open my browser (Chrome) for the first time and try to save an image to my desktop. I repeat, it happens only once when starting any Internet browsing and trying to save an image to my desktop. Any subsequent savings to my desktop happen normally. When the error happens, sometimes the operation (saving the image) goes ahead anyway, but often it crashes the browser, Chrome has to be killed to go back to normality (very annoying and cannot be ignored).<br>

				<div class="content">Nothing really. I right click on the image to save in Chrome and a menu comes up where I click "Save image as", and just after a fraction of a second the error comes up, if it comes up at all. As I mentioned it is difficult to recreate, as it doesn't happen often, actually sporadic would best describe it. Today for example it didn't happen at all. I would say though that if it happens it is always when opening Chrome for the first time. I'll keep monitoring it and see if anything relevant can be reported.</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Tzuk and Osaban,<br>
<br>
I am experiencing the same problem:<br>
- it occurs with simple 'save as' operation for images, but also<br>
- with a save as for a program file that is being downloaded<br>
<br>
The only extension in my Chrome installation that may have an interaction with the 'save as' function could be 'Adblock Plus'. The rest are: 'click &amp; clean', 'lastpass', 'neater bookmarks', 'xmarks'.<br>
<br>
I am running:<br>
- Windows 8 (32-bit)<br>
- Sandboxie 4.02<br>
- Bitdefender Internet Security 2013<br>
<br>
I did not experience this issue with sandboxie 3.76.<br>
<br>
With kind regards,<br>
<br>

				<div class="content">I fixed one or two causes that trigger this error in version 4.03.02.  But I guess there is still something else.  I'll play with Chrome in Windows 8 for a bit to see if I can trigger these errors.</div>

				<div class="content">It definitely happens with Chrome, and only when launching the browser, after doing it the first time, it doesn't happen again as long  as the browsing session lasts. I also noticed that the 'saving window' remains blank for about 30 seconds (activating the error from SB) and eventually the process goes back to normal. I've tried repeatedly with Internet Explorer 10, and it <strong>does not</strong> happen. Therefore it is Chrome related.<br>
My Chrome extensions are: Google dictionary, AdBlock, and StumbleUpon.</div>

				<div class="content">Well v 4.03.03 seems to have solved the problem or at least made it really a rare occurrence. It was happening at every launch of Chrome upon saving an image. I have already launched Chrome 5 times, and it works perfectly... It looks good, thank you Tzuk.</div>

when coming out of hibernation with 2 ie apps and 6 chrome apps. Seems consistent upon coming out of hibernation, but has no bad effect that I have noticed. This has only started happening since the latest sandboxie version. It might be coincidental that I have visited a bunch of web-dev sites - could they have inserted malware?<br>
<br>
I have an up to date windows 7 home premium that is only running ms antimalware and sandboxie - everything else is vanilla. Chrome is up to date: Version 27.0.1453.116 m (I did a fresh chrome installation about 2 months ago with sb disabled).<br>
<br>
cheers,<br>
