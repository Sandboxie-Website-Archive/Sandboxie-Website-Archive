				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Thu May 04, 2017 9:27 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I have been using SB for years, I used to be able to delete the SB using "SB Control" Delete Contents, and the SB browser either Firefox or Chrome would be completely deleted.  In addition Gmail which i have several Gmal email accts would be cleared and I had to put in user and password.   For some time now using the same process on chrome it still asks if I want to recover the recent closed and worse my email acct info I was using before I deleted the SB is still there, and gmail forcing me to continue to use either same or another acct, instead of just a clean login without it knowing the previous log in.<br>
<br>
How do i completely erase the default browser "chrome" SB so it no longer remembers the recent closed or recovers and wipes out the email login so I am starting with clean login?</div>

				<div class="content">Sorry, Barb the answer provided was not any help.  In fact I have never even seen the screen listed in that image.  My setup on SB is default, it has always worked before.  However, that is no longer the case, Google and Gmail have changed how they do things so after a little more research this seemed to work for me.<br>
<br>
Apparently, in Google or Gmail account settings there was a setting for "stay signed in", I used to never click that pre-2017 "stay signed in" except by accident sometimes. No problem I would just delete Sandbox with SB Control then use CCleaner clean all cache and saved stuff, relaunch SB-Chrome and no more saved sign-in info for gmail.  That no longer works, the "stay signed in" is no longer on the login screen nor is it located in 'Gmail or Google Settings.<br>
I came across the following article <a href="https://techjourney.net/disable-google-choose-an-account-sign-in-page/" class="postlink">https://techjourney.net/disable-google- ... n-in-page/</a>, which uses the following to disable "stay signed in"<br>
• log into email acct, Disable Account Chooser by entering <br>
 <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/optintoaccountchooser?optout=1" class="postlink">https://www.google.com/accounts/optinto ... r?optout=1</a><br>
• Next I cleared the original non-sandboxed Chrome's Browsing Data in Settings &gt; Advanced Settings, open the timer choose from beginning.  Followed that by deleting the chrome sandbox with SB Control, next I used CCleaner to make sure all is deleted. Opened the non-sandboxed Chrome and go to gmail.com, check for no login info present.  I tested the gmail inside a Sandboxed chrome browser,  logging in and log out and my login info was NOT saved.<br>

				<div class="content">I apologise for kidnapping this tread, I will move my question to a new one if you say I should.<br>
<br>
But it's a bit about the same - about the Gmail/Google log-in. It's a bit of a lazy question but anyway, here goes:<br>
<br>
I had my account name saved in the Firefox under the Email fiend in the old Gmail log-on. So I only had to click on the Email filed and select my account name, then type in the password and I was in my Gmail.<br>
<br>
Now, with the new Gmail log-on, I have to manually type in my account name first and then my password in order to enter in ma Gmail.<br>
<br>
How can I make Firefox remember my account name, just like with the old Gmail log-in form?<br>
<br>
Thank you. And sorry again for kidnapping the tread.</div>

				<div class="content">from the link that was provided..<br>
To re-enable Account Chooser, you have to visit this link to reset the cookies, and enable the Account Chooser: <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/optintoaccountchooser" class="postlink">https://www.google.com/accounts/optintoaccountchooser</a><br>
so...<br>
Login to Gmail in url bar put that url, hit enter,  <br>
quit gmail or log out<br>
go back to gmail login page<br>
put your login, and there should be "stay signed in"  click that and enter gmail.  <br>
log out, try a new tab or delete SB sandbox and restart browser, go to gmail your login name should be there still.<br>
<br>
Note I haven't tried this with this latest version of Google/Gmail acct login.. However, this is how I used to do it.<br>
The key is turning on account chooser in google/gmail<br>
<br>
good luck<br>
btw I was a hardcore long time Firefox user, and the owner of SB urged me to change to Chrome after so many FF crashes.  I still do not trust Google but for the sake of smooth browsing, I have to say Chrome is great.  The combination of SB + Chrome I use Avast free, (Malwarebytes not running in background, if I want fast scan) has resulted in ZERO viruses on my system for over 6 or 7 years part of that time I used Firefox.  Chrome has quirks but usually can find answers.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi, thank you!<br>
<br>
I did what you said and was able to keep my account in the account chooser, so I only had to enter password.<br>
<br>
But this is not exactly what I had before. Before I simply had my email remembered by Firefox in the field "Email" (if you look at your old login pic).<br>
<br>
Before, when I went to the Gmail, both fields (Email and Password) were empty and if I clicked on the Email field my email name appeared. So I only had to chose it and then enter the password.<br>
<br>
This is, like, one step before having the account name already entered and only having to enter the password, but that's how I like it and would like it to be again.<br>
<br>
I am unable to make Firefox remember with the new Gmail login... Ideas are welcome.<br>
<br>
<img src="../i.imgur.com/WlMDeaJ.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
And by the way, I've been a hardcore FF user for, hm, almost 15 years now? It has it's quirks but it certainly is usable and I intend to keep on using it, I never liked Chrome. Regarding Sandboxie, last time I had malware on any of my computers (outside of the sandbox that is) was in 2008, when I lost my data. Of course I wasn't using Sandboxie back then, when I found SBIE everything changed. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

Thank you for the updated screenshots/steps, I am sure they will help other users in the future. <br>

Bellzemos,<br>
<br>
I launched Firefox outside Sandboxie, cleared its contents (ctrl+ shift+del --&gt; Everything), logged in to Gmail and, when prompted, selected for Firefox to remember my login/password.<br>
I signed out of gmail and closed Firefox.<br>
Then, I launched Firefox Sandboxed and the credentials auto-appeared when I navigated to gmail. <br>
<br>
If you do not want it to remember your password, the easiest way I found (there might be better ways to do this) was to open Firefox outside Sbie --&gt; Options --&gt; Security ---&gt; Saved Logins<br>
Click "Show Passwords" at the bottom.<br>
Right click on your account "Edit password" , change it to " - "  <br>
Hit close.<br>
<br>
Are you having issues that are specific to your Sandboxed browser? <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>

<br>
yes, thers should be a different, easier way to do this. What I'd like to achieve is have my email name remembered but not the password.<br>
<br>
With the old Gmail login all I had to do was run Firefox outside of sandbox, type my name in the Email field and press enter. Then repeat for the nuber of Gmail accounts I wanted to use on the computer.<br>
<br>
When I'd then run Firefox sandboxed and click on the Email field at the old Gmail login screen, I got offered all the email account names.<br>
<br>
I guess the new field in the new Gmail login form is different and Firefox won't remember the name...</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Bellzemos ,<br>
<br>
If the gmail login features have changed,  there is nothing Sandboxie will be able to do to modify that. <br>
How does it work on your host? Is it the same behavior?<br>
The steps I provided  before will return your user name, and then "- " as your password, which means you will have to type it every time. <br>
<br>
If your issue only occurs in your Sandboxed Firefox, please provide steps to reproduce so that I can test it. <br>
<br>

Barb.-</div>

<br>
no, I know, this is not a Sandboxie issue. I just tought that maybe someone on the boards would have an answer.<br>
<br>
I've posted the question on the Firefox forums now:<br>
