				<h3>Windows 10 Black Screen of Doom</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello All,<br>
<br>
I recently purchased sandboxie after a nasty virus attack in which I had to reinstall windows. I bought sandboxie for home use and installed it immediately. Everything was working fine, then the next day I went to start my computer and after the login in screen on my computer took an unusually long time to log me in the only thing that appeared was a black screen an my mouse. <br>
<br>
After the virus attack I began using system restore points like crazy so simply reverted to the prior days restore point. I downloaded SB again and everything was fine, until today I went to start my computer and again the same problem happened. Again I simply reverted to the restore point before I downloaded SB, but this bug is keeping me from using the program.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions? Has this happened to anyone else?<br>
<br>
Here is some info about my PC<br>
<br>
WIN 10 EDU Edition, intel I-5 7600k cpu, 64 bit OS.<br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>
