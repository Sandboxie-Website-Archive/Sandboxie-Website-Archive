				<h3>[.09] Removed Low-Level and Hardware Access Settings</h3>

				<div class="content">I removed the Low-Level Access and Hardware Access settings pages from the Sandbox Settings window in version 4.01.09.<br>
Reminder screenshot:<br>
<br>
<a href="../index7ac3.html?RestrictionsSettings#lowlevel" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?Rest ... s#lowlevel</a><br>
<a href="../index7ac3.html?RestrictionsSettings#hardware" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?Rest ... s#hardware</a><br>
<br>
With version 4, many of these settings do not function correctly anymore, that is to say, they no longer make it possible for a program in the sandbox to do stuff outside the sandbox.<br>
<br>
I feel these were rather esoteric settings that saw little use, so I don't t think they justify the time investment to make them work in version 4.  Some of them are even incompatible with the way things work under the hood in version 4.<br>
<br>
I would point out that I feel the setting "Permit programs in this sandbox to simulate keyboard and mouse input" was perhaps used mostly to get rid of message <a href="../indexeadc.html?SBIE1304" class="postlink">SBIE1304</a> Blocked simulated keyboard or mouse input by process program.exe.  So in version 4.01.09 Sandboxie no longer issues message SBIE1304.<br>
<br>
Please note that behind the scenes Sandboxie still recognizes at this time some of these settings, if they appear in Sandboxie.ini.  This may change in the future.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey tzuk,<br>
<br>
Just looking at what you're talking about here.  Could you check this setting out:<br>
<br>
Sandbox Setting --&gt; Applications --&gt; Miscellaneous<br>
<br>
the 2nd option there reads<br>
<br>
err=00000F62 ... str1=                          ... str2=<br>
<br>
In previous versions, I think this option also had something to do with the hardware access.  This doesn't look right to me.</div>

				<div class="content">I use sanboxie with a sand boxed program needing text cut and pasted from outside the sandbox (from note pad or IE10 or Firefox)<br>
<br>
it's not working now and if I try the program locks up<br>
<br>
are the changes causing my problem and is there a way to allow it to work again as myself and and family use this all the time<br>
<br>
if not, will you reconsider the changes to allow this again ?</div>

Copy/paste issues are fixed in version 4.03.04, you should upgrade to this version.</div>

				<h3>Great upgrade -Except  Removed &quot;Simulate Keyboard &amp;</h3>

				<div class="content">With the removal of this function "Permit programs in this sandbox to simulate keyboard and mouse input" - this has eliminated Sandboxed programs from "Scraping &amp; Copying" from open Browser (Opera /Firefox) - rendering the Sandbox program in this case from efectively running and doing it's job.<br>
<br>
Any way around this? - These settings did not carry over to the 4x version (not the 4.4 version). When upgraded from 3.76 - had to uninstall/re-install the older 3.76 version to keep this setting available and checked off - and the program worked just fine again in the Sandbox.<br>
