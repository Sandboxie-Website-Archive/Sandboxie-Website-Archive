<br>
Updated 25-Jan-2016<br>
Vivaldi beta 1.0.344.37 32-bit (Installed inside SB on Win 7/64 works perfectly)<br>
Palemoon 28.8.1 64-bit (Installed inside SB on Win 7/64 works perfectly)<br>
Woolyss Chromium version 49.0.2598.0 64-bit (Installed inside SB on Win 7/64 doesn't work, displays multiple small partial "pictures" of the Chromium tabs, happened in the past with Chrome)<br>
Chromium 50.0.2626.0 32-bit from <a href="https://download-chromium.appspot.com/" class="postlink">https://download-chromium.appspot.com</a>, just extracted from ZIP inside SB and run, same behavior.<br>
<br>
Craig, this is a report. Not a complaint. I know that you recommend to install directly and just run in Sandboxie. But that defeats one of the important purposes as beautifully depicted here: <a href="../index440c.html?HowItWorks" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?HowItWorks</a> So I report to help (hopefully) not to bitch.<br>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the info. While we hope users are able to install program "x" into SBIE directly, that isn't always possible, especially with Win 10.Web browsers however have had a decent track record. Biggest issues is updating them within the SB. That's the most problematic.</div>

				<div class="content">I'd prefer if you'd focus your efforts on making sure these browsers can update successfully. I have had Chrome break on me repeatedly in a sandbox, usually because in the background it downloaded an update and so now Sandboxie launches the copy of Chrome in the sandbox (which does not work). Fixing this involves deleting the folder C:\Sandbox\Username\Chrome\drive then I download the new Chrome outside the sandbox and install it.

This thread is useful for users that have questions and/or problems with browsers into a sandbox. This is a common question that needs to be addressed. It's a resource.<br>
<br>
Oh Actually, it's our recommendation you <strong>update browsers outside</strong> of the sandbox (Latest 38.6 of Thunderbird as well requires this). Which comes directly from the Dev. That applies to other programs as well, but specifically browsers/TBird.<br>
<br>
Of course, then delete the contents of that sandbox before relaunching the updated browser. Otherwise, the cache is the sb from the other previous version will cause problems. Remember, a sb is not designed to be permanent storage.<br>
<br>
If you prefer, you can determine the service that FF, Chrome, TBird use and allow direct access to that in SBIE to permit that, edit your .ini and hopefully avoid a service update loop in Chrome/FF that will cause you headaches, but you will also need to have that sb deleted before the update applies to avoid the cache issue. <br>
<br>
Building that into SBIE is not something are looking to do, it would create a hole in the SB &amp; adds unneeded code and complexity to a problem that is easily solved otherwise by just updating outside.<br>
<br>
We know were we need to focus our efforts. While I give the Devs updates on what I am seeing in the forum &amp; in testing and I defer to them.<br>
Like....<br>
Keeping up w/ browser builds<br>
Windows 10 Builds<br>
Metro / Edge Support<br>
In going Security changes dictated by MS (For Win10 particularly, but applies to other versions)<br>
Office Click 2 Run<br>
.....and other issues just to make sandboxie "work."<br>
<br>
Thanks for the concern.</div>

Wow. You're welcome? I guess. Of course I know the long standing position to update outside of the browser, I just thought there must be a better way. I lose time doing the manual updates. When someone tries to start Chrome and sees a hanging page it's not a good experience.</div>

				<div class="content">Updating outside of the sandbox used to work, but as various browsers updated, they started getting more and more picky in a way.<br>
<br>
It seemed to first start with Chrome..then FF..and now we're seeing it Tbird. There may be service path that could be opened to allow it, but we're back to punching a hole in the sb.<br>
<br>
Once the path is determined, we (or someone that beats us to it) can post it in the forum. I don't see this being added to the code as again at the moment. It could be an option you tick in Application Settings that would be off by default<br>
<br>
But again, you have the issue with the "old" version cache being in the sandbox that would have to be cleared and the program will be terminated as a result. So that will add to the complexity in a way.</div>

Why would I want to install Firefox or Thunderbird (I'm using both) into a sandbox anyway? My understanding is that the only exposed directory outside the sandbox are the profiles, plus of course anything you add like "Downloads".  I don't see how a malware can exploit that even if it manages to get into the browser cache or related, as I'm forcing these programs to run sandboxed only.</div>

Please use a current version of SBIE. This is the most likely issue. You're waaaay behind.<br>
<br>
Chrome/flash when they update, can also lead the need of updating SBIE. You're very behind in both. Try the beta 5.11.11 or stable 5.10...I'd try the beta. As the thread stated, the tests are done with the latest or very close to the last beta.</div>
