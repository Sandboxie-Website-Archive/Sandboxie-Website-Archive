				<div class="content">Firstly as this is my first post, thanks for this brilliant application. I use it everyday and rave about it to anyone who wants to listen!<br>
<br>
I tend to set up a new sandbox for each installation. That way it is easier to identify what each program is doing and just delete the sandbox if I don't like it.<br>
<br>
I have about 50 sandboxes at the moment which means a lot of scrolling up of down the list. It would be great to be able to organise the sandboxes in a heirarchy, bit like the original XP start menu.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for this app, it means that I can install stuff just to take a look with no worried</div>

<br>
I dont use that much Sandboxes but at least 5.<br>
I prefer the old "Files and Folders" view also.<br>
The new layout looks nice but takes a little bit more clicks and mouse-movement to work your way around.</div>
