As you can see:<br>

<br>
I have a sandbox for just about everything.<br>
<br>
I started using Sandboxie as a trial version.. and whilst it was great, I just really needed the extra features of auto-start apps, and multiple simultaneous sandboxes.<br>
<br>
Since Sandboxie as a trial version had never let me down.. I decided to upgrade. Let me say.. Best - choice - ever : ]<br>
<br>
This app is s.o.l.i.d. -- it has not crashed or let me down even once -- and I use it for absolutely everything.<br>
<br>
Previously, I used to norton ghost my system every 2 to 6 months.. I haven't been using Sandboxie that long yet, but my intention is to depend on ghost far less than previously. And so far its looking great.<br>
<br>
Also, Tzuk is very interested in releasing new versions, and always listening to what the users have to say.<br>
<br>
I rarely buy an app online, maybe once or twice per year on average.. so the fact that I bought Sandboxie after using the trial, should be significant enough that show I am truly impressed.</div>
