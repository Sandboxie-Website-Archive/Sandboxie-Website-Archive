				<div class="content">I had heard of this program at:<br>
<a href="http://www.techsupportalert.com/best_46_free_utilities.htm" class="postlink">http://www.techsupportalert.com/best_46 ... lities.htm</a><br>
but was too lazy to install it or even check it out.<br>
Finally I have checked it out, installed it and have run it for several days.<br>
Once you get the hang of it it's fairly easy.<br>
Have already emailed 10 friends about this program.<br>
I hope they will use it so I don't have to clean up their systems as often.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
I decided to Register and give my little part for support.<br>
I can't understand why everyone doesn't use this program.  What is there to loose.  Small footprint too.<br>
Thanks for all your work Tzuk</div>
