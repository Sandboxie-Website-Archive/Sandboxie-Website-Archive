				<div class="content">Many thanks to tzuk for creating Sandboxie.  <br>
It is the best single security software of all.  <br>
<br>
Way to go tzuk, I don't see how you did alone it for this long.<br>
Now maybe you can get a little well deseved rest.  <br>
<br>
I'm looking forward to improvements by the Invincea team.  <br>
They will have more resources than tzuk could possibly have alone.  <br>
<br>
Invincea's acquisition should be viewed as a positive development, imho.  <br>
Observe the quick release of version 4.08. . .haven't tried it yet but it was quick and needed.<br>
Most of the gloom &amp; doom posts about Invincea's involvement just indicate the worry felt by longtime users.</div>
