I was able to repro this in Win 8.1 x64 and other OSs. <br>
Here's a workaround:<br>

				<div class="content">I think  I was one of the few guys that got the first SB license  when it was still in early development, than  I haven't used it for years until few months ago since SB got so much better.<br>
<br>
Now....SB became a big part of my security add-on  for my browsers and I really like it.<br>
<br>
When comes to browsers I really like the fact that FF is becoming more safe in some of the security aspects but it seems that is also adding additional conflict to SB as I have just found out by installing the latest FF 56.0 x64.<br>
<br>
I couldn't figure out at first why I didn't have sound while running SB until I stumbled upon this thread. I hope that SB developer can keep up with the fixes so we don't have to go the short way and dropping  levels of security within FF itself.<br>
<br>
Thank you<br>

				<div class="content">Thank you for the reply Barb. The work around worked perfectly!<br>
<br>
Just to clarify, the difference between security level 3 and security level 2 is that level 3 blocks: <br>
Read access to most of the filesystem <br>
Excludes themes/GTK configuration, fonts, shared data and libraries<br>
<br>
I am not very knowledgeable with computer concepts, but based on your post that Firefox currently uses the same security level 2, I assume that blocking the read access to most of the filesystem isn't a super critical safety component.<br>
<br>
Basically, reducing the security level isn't putting anything in jeopardy.<br>
<br>
Thank you once again and much appreciation!</div>

				<div class="content">I got audio to work when Firefox is in Sandboxie by changing the security level to 2 (it was set to 3). Make sure you have taken Firefox out of Sandboxie at first. Then, start Firefox and type in "about:config" (without quotes) into the URL box. Firefox displays a warning. I accepted the consequences. Typed into the search box "security.sandbox.content.level" (without quotes) and that should appear below. Click on modify the value and enter 2. If that doesn't work you can keep reducing that value to 0 security level... not advised. Then, when you break out of Firefox, put Firefox back into Sandboxie. Then, you should now have audio in youtube.<br>

</div></blockquote>

Not related. As I noted above it only happens when the application is run inside sandboxie. The security sandbox level in firefox was increased from 2 to 3 which I forgot to modify in my user.js prefs script. In future firefox releases it will be raised to level 4. We're stuck on security.sandbox.content.level 2 until sandboxie supports the higher content security levels.<br>
