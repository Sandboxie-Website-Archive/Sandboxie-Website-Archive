				<div class="content">I am absolutely confident that sandboxie is the only response to the threats of being connected to the internet today.<br>
No Malware can do any harm, with the closedfilepath-options, even read access can be stopped, regardless what scum tries to get hold of your Windowsmachine or your Data, sandboxie will block it.<br>
With the force option not even an accidental invocation of IE can do any harm. It is simply great.<br>
<br>
And all my questions have been answered by the creator of this valuable piece of SW in this forum almost immediately.<br>
<br>
All that for 20 bucks, I am impressed. I would have paid up to five times that price for a program like that and that support.<br>
<br>
10 Stars out of 10 from my point of view!</div>

				<div class="content">I second all of that.  Great program and great service.  I don't know how I ever got along without it.<br>
<br>
Now I'm beginning to worry whether we'll be able to continue using this great program (or a future generation of it) after we are "forced" to use Windows Vista next year.  (I say "forced," because eventually Windows users will have to change to Vista in order to use newer versions of other essential software.)<br>
<br>
Tzuk, any forecasts about the future of Sandboxie under Vista?<br>
