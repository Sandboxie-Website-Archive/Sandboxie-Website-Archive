				<div class="content">I've searched the forums for similar issues but found nothing matching my specific scenario. Plus, the latest posts were a couple years back on older versions of both Sandboxie and Bluestacks.<br>
<br>
I downloaded and installed fresh version of sandboxie - ver 5.22 64 bit on win10<br>
downloaded bluestacks-installer <br>
from bluestacks.com - bluestacks 3.xxx<br>
<br>
i created new sandbox called bluestacks<br>
i selected the installer from windows explorer, right clicked and selected 'run sandboxed'<br>
during install i saw this error<br>
SBIE2224 Sandboxed program has crashed: HD-UnRegRegCom.exe [bluestacks]<br>
installer continued and seemed to be successful <br>
bluestacks ui launched and i kept seeing the following error, repeatedly.<br>
SBIE2224 Sandboxed program has crashed: HD-Player.exe [bluestacks]<br>
pressing the red-X in upper corner of bluestacks generated this error<br>
SBIE2224 Sandboxed program has crashed: HD-Quit.exe [bluestacks]<br>
<br>
even though it was a clean install, uninstalled, rebooted.  installed again, rebooted, ran installer again and saw exact same behavior.<br>
no AV made any noise about the processes. <br>
i am running norton security but there were no popups or warnings or anything else that would indicated any interference.  <br>
<br>
Has anyone seen same issues and has any one resolved?</div>

<br>
I am able to reproduce the issue when trying to install the application in the Sandbox. Not sure if we'll find a fix for that, however you can install the application on your host, and then run it Sandboxed so it doesn't modify your computer.<br>
<br>
I did make the devs aware and I will update this post if anything else comes up.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>
