				<div class="content">What exactly are the risk of allowing access to the entire profile folder.<br>
<br>
My reason for heavily conseridering this.<br>
<br>
Quite a few of my addons need to write things that will be kept so they can work as intended, like the Reddit Enhancement Suite, Ad Block Plus, NoSquint etc.<br>
<br>
When i delete my sandbox, all changes made by those addons are lost, and i'll have to do it over and over.<br>
<br>
<br>
My default download folder for my browser is set for a folder thats forced to be boxed.<br>
<br>
What are the risk that i face doing this.<br>
<br>
Will a "drive by download" infect my system?</div>

See Guest10's thread on how to save your settings. He's a lot smarter than me when it comes to those settings.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
I don't think you'll find a better explanation for what you want than this.<br>
<br>
Read the entire thread.<br>
<br>
BTW. I use Noscript, .. Adblock Plus, and Noscript and used the method he shows.<br>

				<div class="content">Thanks Hank, i guess i'll allow access to the entire profile folder.<br>
<br>
Still somewhat paranoid about malware infected me by downloading to that folder.<br>
<br>
Another good addon for sites that don't email you about changes to topics, is this<br>
