<br>
I want to make it clear that I don't think at all that people who got the lifetime license are being hypocritical in any way.<br>
I was happy to be able to offer the lifetime license deal, and I appreciate all of you who supported my work by getting it.<br>
We can say it was an early adopter perk, you guys were there for me in those earlier years, and I really appreciate that.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

				<div class="content">I can barely stomach the OP without being sick that such a viewpoint can be conjured up by an educated, responsible and intelligent person. He seems to know as much about himself on his profile as he does Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
The comments are unbelievably abusive, crude and downright insulting, the kind of outburst made by a person who has no financial idea whatsoever of successfully marketing a highly technical and complex product into what is an unstable market environment.<br>
<br>
Tzuk is too much of a gentleman to reply to this kind of riff-raff attack in the manner it deserves, but if it was me, I would  certainly ruffle this guy`s feathers and he would not enjoy the experience.<br>
<br>
I suggest that this disgusting thread be deleted and the OP banned from the Forum.</div>

				<div class="content">Sandboxie is and has been for several years on my "DO Install" list. (Currently using v4.06) <br>
When Windows XP ends it's (EOL) support in 4/2014 I will have to decide whether to<br>
continue using XP with Sandboxie or jump to a Linux Distro.<br>
<br>
I only wish Tzuk would consider making Sandboxie run on a Linux Distro.<br>
That to I would gladly pay for.<br>
<br>
Another option worth considering is to install a Linux Distro, then install VirtualBox.<br>
Next install Windows XP OS in the VM and then install Sandboxie.</div>

				<div class="content">Sandboxie is a tremendous value at the purchase price.  <br>
One of the 2 best security applications I have ever used.  <br>
I hope tzuk gets well paid for his efforts.<br>
<br>
edit:<br>
I bought the license when one didn't really have to just because the software was so good.  <br>
Found out that the paid version was much richer in capabilities, easily worth the price.</div>

				<div class="content">Why not add a (more expensive) computer/OS license - based on a hardware-key. <br>
- Upgrade / reinstall OS means you have to buy a new license<br>
- New PC means you have to buy a new license<br>

But no yearly license updates to keep things easy.</div>

<br>
I just did the math, and that would have cost our household <strong>over 1 million US dollars</strong> in the last 2 years since buying Sandboxie!!!!!! <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed"><br>
<br>
Kidding! I actually just finished cleaning my monitor, keyboard, and desk from all the soda I spit out after reading your proposal 5 days ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
No offense, but definitely the worst idea evar. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad"> <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>
