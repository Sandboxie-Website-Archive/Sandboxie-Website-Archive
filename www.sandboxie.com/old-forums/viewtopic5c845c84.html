				<div class="content">I just purchased your program, coming from me it is a real compliment.<br>
Yours just was the answer to all my problems, being these:<br>
<br>
-I have re-installed Windows XP at least 150 times, no lie, all <br>
because I have INTERNET connected.<br>
- I used Ghost and all backup programs to no avail, they all lack 1 <br>
thing, when your PC is polluted, you have to put the backup back,but <br>
you have installed a 1000 things in the meantime you need, so your <br>
backup is useless and you need the PC in 5 minutes for work or some <br>
important printout.<br>
- Being an embedded software specialist and a computer expert, when <br>
you connect to the internet, you are vulnerable the moment you connect, <br>
and a dummy waiting to be attacked, which happens, before using <br>
Sandboxie I had a virus scanner, 2 anti spyware and anti-rootkit <br>
scanner running and?? Still got 16 harmless infections even when <br>
updating every 2 hours!!!.<br>
<br>
So I concluded, the only way to keep your PC safe is NOT TO USE <br>
INTERNET, like I advised my father, he does NOT need it and still his <br>
PC works flawlessly after 1 year.<br>
<br>
So thank you for your (registered) program, it allows me to use my PC <br>
for at least 1 year without irritation of crashing and putting backups <br>
back when I don't have the time.<br>
<br>
You can use my e-mail to promote your product..thank you!<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Tony.</div>
