				<div class="content">I'd like to use Sandboxie at work (I've already talked to tzuk about licensing costs), but the lack of network drive support is pretty much a show-stopper.  The main user application I'd like to sandbox is a network app -- it runs off of the network and writes to the network.  I have no way of changing this.<br>
<br>
So, what are the chances of network drive support being added into a future release of Sandboxie?<br>
<br>
<br>
Barring network drive support, is there any way to sandbox *just the child processes of a given application*?  That is, don't sandbox the main application (since it doesn't work when sandboxed), but automatically sandbox anything it spawns?  While not perfect, I believe this would be a satisfactory work-around.<br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">In version 2.7x, there is no special treatment for network drives.  They get sandboxed just like any local drive.  This means you can apply the usual OpenFilePath also for network drives.<br>
<br>
In other words, you could say:  these drives (or maybe just particular folders or files within them) should not be sandboxed.<br>
<br>
I think that would solve your problem.</div>

That sounds absolutely perfect!<br>
<br>
Do you have a release date in mind for v2.7?  All I see on the download page is 2.64.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">Version 2.7 has been going through beta testing for about a couple of weeks now, and it will probably take a few more weeks before it's fully stabilized.<br>
<br>
(But it's pretty usable even at this point, I would say.)<br>
<br>
You can get it from the Announcements forum.</div>
