I'm running steam through sandboxie due to necessity - only one instance will run on any single computer (despite being different users). When I launch a steam game, the game starts in the sandbox (which is fine) but it seems to ignore the devices I have set in the workplaces screen on aster.<br>
<br>
For example, I have workstation 1 set up with a specific sound device, and workstation 2 set up with a different one.<br>
When I launch the game on workstation 1, it uses the correct speakers. When I launch either the same game on workstation 2, it uses the speakers on workstation 1.<br>
<br>
Both applications are running in their own separate sandbox (because we are logged in as different users, proof is that steam actually opens)<br>
<br>
Is there a way to force a given sandbox to forward all audio to a specific sound device?<br>
<br>
Are there plans to look into this problem, and fix it? I assume that it's caused by sandboxie forwarding the sound driver device at a lower level than Aster is patching it (or whatever magic they're doing).</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the advice Barb - sorry I didn't notice this sooner. Apparently I don't get notifications.<br>
<br>
I had a look through the urls suggested on that page, and the closest one I could find was the one suggesting I allow direct access to sound devices. Sadly though, the advice given must have been for an older version as I was unable to follow along...</div>
