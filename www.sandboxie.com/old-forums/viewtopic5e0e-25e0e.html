				<div class="content">When running PC Pitstop's Optimize software in the sandbox, it hangs using 100% CPU when scanning "Registry For Invalid CLSID's".<br>
<br>
This is just the trial version that can't change anything. From what I understand, it simply scans and reads the reg.<br>
<br>
Shouldn't it work in Sandboxie?<br>
<br>
Here is the link to the software:<br>

<a href="http://www.pcpitstop.com/store/optimize.asp" class="postlink">http://www.pcpitstop.com/store/optimize.asp</a><br>
<br>
(By the way, it works outside of the sandbox.)<br>
<br>
Also, this may also be the same issue and possibly the same answer. When I scan using Secunia Software Inspector ( <a href="http://secunia.com/software_inspector/" class="postlink">http://secunia.com/software_inspector/</a> ) it shows an error when trying to determine if I have all the latest Windows Updates and then also hangs.</div>

				<div class="content">Technically it doesn't hang.  It just runs very, very slowly.<br>
<br>
At least part of the problem is that the keys, as they are scanned, are opened for write access.  This causes Sandboxie to create a separate sandboxed key for each instance.  Since there are thousands of keys in the CLSID area of the registry, this takes a looooooong time.<br>
<br>
I was able to speed it up (manually) by going into the sandboxed registry with RegEdit, and deleting the sandboxed keys created as a side-effect of the scan.<br>
<br>
When there are no sandboxed keys, Sandboxie has a lot less "merging" to do, so this considerably speeds up the process.  But like I said, this is a manual "fix".<br>
<br>
But after doing this during the scan of CLSIDs, the program goes on to scan ProgIDs, TypeLibs, and Interfaces (all below HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT).  Finally it goes on to scan the entire registry ... <br>
<br>
But eventually I got to "Scan Complete"  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation"> <br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
So, I can say there's no bug here, this is just how Sandboxie works:  if a program declares it wants write access to a key, then the key is duplicated . . .  It's too bad that a program that just scans stuff, opens everything for write access.</div>
