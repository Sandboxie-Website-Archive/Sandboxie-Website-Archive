Cool. Do you have any plans to control number of activations/simultaneous installations, like I gave an idea in last paragraph <a href="viewtopic38393839.html?p=104044#p104044" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 44#p104044</a> ?</div>

if they had it so that there was only so many activations then i wouldn't bother. the hole point of lifetime license is being able to use it as many times as you want long as you are using it on one computer unless its for more then 1. if they had it lets say only 15 or so activations then it wouldn't really be a lifetime license.</div>

Knight, I used my lifetime licenses in the three computers that I owned since I purchased it. Always using it on two at a time. When my  laptop got stolen I replaced it for an identical one. I don't know how many times my license has been activated but its got to be many many times. I never had a problem with the license. If you get a license as long as you use it only in computers that you own, you shouldn't have any kind of issues for as long as you want to use it. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>

Bo, licensing terms had changed, now it is for 1 computer the whole time or as many computers you like but <strong>one</strong> at the time.<br>
Our past lifetime license terms allow what you are saying but not now.</div>

Mr X, what I was trying to come across is that the number of activations is not an issue as long as you use it in computers that you personally own and using it complying with the terms under which you buy the license.<br>

Well said Bo, we should keep in mind is not an issue as long as the license is used in personally own machines, very important this.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>

				<div class="content">I'm a old user of sandboxie, and i find the new license therms simply shocking!<br>
For a private non commercial use anything else than lifetime + unlimited PC's is simple obscene.<br>
<br>
A private user will use normally only one sandboxie at a time but may often switch PC's (many times a day),<br>
asking him to pay for each PC as if he would be employer having multiple employees using all installed instances permanently is just ridicules.<br>
<br>
Also on a side note, requiring online activation is simply bad taste!<br>
<br>
Sorry for the rant but I'm simply shocked what sandboxie became.</div>

				<div class="content">I thought it's gonna be like home user pay only once (for lifetime license) but number of PC's will be limited to 5. +Users can manage (delete) which PC doesn't need the license any longer. Similar to the old personal (lifetime) license but with limited simultaneous installations.</div>

				<div class="content">And you think 5 PC's is enough?<br>
I mean a typical geek has, a desktop PC, a laptop or two, probably a windows tablet, a wearable computer on his body, thats already 5, and this is not counting any VM's<br>
It should be without any limitation on simultaneous installations.<br>
<br>
Besides the old price was like 30$ for unlimited lifetime, and now you get only 5 PC's for more than twice the prise? Thats plain wrong.</div>

I paid almost US$43.00 and have never used my license in more than 2 computers at the same time. Right this moment, you can get the 3 lifetime license bundle for 7 more dollars. That is a good deal.<br>

LOL I love the pic...Fine mate, I agree with those alternatives you mentioned above, then you go buy them, maybe Sandboxie is not for your budget, too expensive (being sarcastic). Oh btw Sandboxie it's the best at sanboxing, high quality have a price, oh btw the actual price it's a bargain, no doubts.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"></div></blockquote>

You'd never expect my thread bump have turned the whole thing around right? <br>
Since u don't represent the users group, nor does the official marketing team....<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Curt@invincea wrote:</cite>The lifetime license for unlimited computers was an early promotion by Ronen in Sbie's early days.  He ended that before Invincea acquired the product.</div></blockquote>
so how does the new lifetime license work exactly?<br>
unlimited activations but only 5 computers max at the same time? or limited 5 activations but lifetime?</div>
