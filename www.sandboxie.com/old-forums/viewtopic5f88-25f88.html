				<div class="content">tzuk, as a result of checking stuff on the laptop (haven't in awhile, it still had .07), I'm now seeing <em>SBIE2204 Cannot start sandboxed service RpcSs</em> for the first time with .11 (with Drop Rights, otherwise default sandbox). Except the error code is <strong>1309</strong> (ERROR_NO_IMPERSONATION_TOKEN?).<br>
<br>
Can't reproduce on main system. Will try to check back with previous versions (.08-.10). Can't think of anything else there, except it hasn't had any Windows updates since Feb. install...<br>
<br>

				<div class="content">OK, it looks like .09, .10, and .11 are the same on the laptop -- just that RpcSs message (1309), not what Guest10 posted. (I haven't used .09 or .10 on main system.)<br>
<br>
Yeah, the laptop had .07 on it before today, and that was fine. <strong>.08</strong> broke with the same RpcSs message, with an additional <em>SBIE2321 Cannot manage device map: [C0000022 / 88]</em> when using Run Sandboxed.<br>
<br>
All fine without Drop Rights.<br>
<br>
<br>
And if there was a problem with Drop Rights on XP in .08 (or any version) I probably wouldn't notice on the main system, since all my "entry point" programs have rights dropped with SRP before forced sandboxing. I simply leave Drop Rights enabled "just in case" or for other occasional stuff...</div>

				<div class="content">Just found it! Same thing was happening on fresh VirtualBox install, even after I applied latest updates (yet I can't reproduce on main system). It was pretty well untouched I figured, except checking over my stuff again quickly, I saw one of the things I DO change initially, just until after I'm done installing everything on a new install:<br>
<br>
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\<strong>nodefaultadminowner</strong> = 0 (instead of default 1)<br>
<br>
So if owner of stuff (objects) tries to be Admin, Sandboxie fails since .08 with Drop Rights. You probably might want to fix this, since it IS a real, legitimate thing people can set (it's a Group Policy option, I believe).<br>
<br>
<br>
Extra info (unrelated to Sandboxie): I was going to use that setting full-time back when I first discovered dropping rights (before Sandboxie <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">), but found that it caused some really, <em>really</em> random/weird things to happen for IE 6 with dropped rights. And on the laptop, it nearly killed me trying to figure out why the Dell wireless thing wouldn't work (running full Admin!), until I discovered it was failing because nodefaultadminowner=0, but ONLY because I hadn't yet set a password for the account!? Strange, strange stuff. I only use it now, temporarily, to make sure installed system stuff/programs is not owned by the user (to protect with dropped rights).</div>

				<div class="content">Alright, this should be taken care of in version 4.01.13.  There was something similar for XP in version 4.01.09 but that was causing problem, and I had to undo that change.  Hopefully I won't have to undo this change as well.</div>

				<div class="content">No, these errors were always there don't have to do with recent changes to Drop Rights.<br>
You can't run services in the sandbox when Drop Rights is enabled.<br>
<br>
Maybe you're trying to run some Microsoft software which is trying to check<br>
for updates through the Automatic Updates service (wuauserv) ?<br>
Try to delete the contents of your sandbox.</div>

				<div class="content">I have always had the "delete function" enabled.  I had never seen those before and I haven't change my configuration since v3.76 or before.  Drop Rights has always been enabled in prior versions since it became available.  I did notice that "silverlight configuration" tried to run so I allowed as I am running with restrictions.  Still don't understand why a Windows Update service is trying to run inside my Firefox sandbox.<br>
