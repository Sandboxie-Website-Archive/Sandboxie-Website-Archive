				<h3>Sandboxie home license for 3 PC [SOLVED]</h3>

				<div class="content">I bought today a 3 pc home license.<br>
Everything went smooth.<br>
I already activated the license on 2 pc with win 8.1 x64.<br>
I have also another HDD on each pc with a test install Win 10 x64.<br>
So I checked the syscode on the same pc for both Win versions (8.1 and 10) with the command:<br>
"C:\Program Files\Sandboxie\License.exe" print syscode<br>
I noticed there are different syscode for the same pc, yet different OS.<br>
My question is: do I need to buy another home license for 3 pc if I want to boot Win 8.1 or Win 10 and have Sandboxie installed and activated on both OS and on all 3 computers ?</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, the hashed lic ID is unique per PC as it uses various things to create that hash..the key, hardware, OS, etc.etc. Technically, a VM is a stand alone system, you're using (or should be using) a separate Windows Key as well for each instance. <br>
<br>
So it works in a similar way for SBIE. As both copies should be individually licensed.<br>
<br>
The license is for up to 3 computers. <br>
<br>
We look for a lot of things regarding key, IP address, etc. If you're activating a machine(s) on the same IP schema as the original is a lot better then say, having a Maryland IP on your key server suddenly change to Europe, etc. That gets the attention of the Key server.<br>
<br>
Please email <a href="mailto:support@sandboxie.com">support@sandboxie.com</a> and we can go into further detail and <strong><em>certainly work with you.</em></strong></div>

I thought it will activate since it is the same PC.<br>
From your reply I understand this will not work  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> <br>
I am testing various programs under these OS: Win 7, Win 8.1 and Win 10 on 2 PC and a laptop.</div>

<br>
However, for licensing terms a VM is licensed as a separate installation - 1 key per 1 OS. A computer is defined as complete system. Different OS, different computer. Even though you're running the same hardware and that's a pretty standard outlook from a licensing perspective.<br>
<br>
Now, will using that same key, in a VM, under the same IP range, etc, etc.... immediately trigger a block on the key server?? Not necessarily. And if it does, we can quickly overcome that fix the issue. Even if it did block, the software will still function, but only in Shareware mode. Which is what A LOT of people use...and use it just fine. <br>
<br>
As for testing, We test in multiple environments. Do we have to register each version just to test? No. As the program you purchased is the FULL version. (minus what I mentioned below)<br>
<br>
The paid version enables multiple SB to be used at the same time, Forced Programs and folders. Otherwise, that's it (for now, more features to come)<br>
<br>
If I'm just testing software and have no need to test forcing anything to load under the auth of SBIE, then I simply don't register it. Yes, I'll get a nag screen. But that's all.</div>

				<div class="content">i am not sure if i got that right.<br>
<br>
do i need separate licenses for each OS on one computer (multiboot)?<br>
<br>
not asking for me but for possible clients with a multiboot system. ofc can only use one same time.<br>
<br>
Cheers.</div>

I do not share the same opinion with you about the PC with different OS seen as a different machine. The hardware is the same !<br>
For example at my work we have the same license for Ansys on Windows and Linux. We can use only one at the time; not both simultaneous. I know it is a big difference, but I just wanted to mention.<br>
Because I like so much Sandboxie and because I would like to support the Invincea team for future development, I decided to buy another home license for 3 PC.<br>
Now I have one license for 3 PC with Win 8.1 and the new license for the same 3 PC but with Win 10.<br>
This way is faster for me (not to wait for <a href="mailto:support@sandboxie.com">support@sandboxie.com</a> to change the syscode on the Key server each time i need).<br>
Thank you Craig.</div>

				<div class="content">Understandable. But, we'll have to agree to disagree. Microsoft enforces it as do many other software vendors. Luckily we don't require a license per CPU per Core Like Oracle and others.<br>
<br>
Same Hardware, yes...but the software running that same hardware can and be different. Also, a lot of vendors charge significantly more for a Volume license. A VM isn't a good excuse to run licensed software over and over. We'd rather keep the cost low so you can buy the licenses you need. Again, if problems arise with licensing, email us. Otherwise, the key system is robust and we log when keys are activated along with various other Meta data (I.P, hardware ID, etc.)<br>
<br>
Then there is the Ethical ramifications.....<br>

While you are free do  as you feel you need to do, we also have to protect the integrity and enforcement of the EULA/ToS that a user agreed upon when purchased and the key server. It's routinely monitored and enforced. We are more than willing to work with people.</div>
