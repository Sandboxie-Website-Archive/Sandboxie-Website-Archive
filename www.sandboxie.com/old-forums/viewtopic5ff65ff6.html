				<h3>SandboxiePortable **NEW THREAD**</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Tue Oct 23, 2007 3:46 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>wraithdu</strong></div>
				<div class="content">LAUNCHER VERSION: <strong>2.3.0.4</strong><br>
INSTALLER VERSION: <strong>1.0.1.2</strong><br>
<br>
PLEASE READ THE README.TXT DURING INSTALLATION FOR INSTRUCTIONS<br>
<br>
** DO NOT USE on a system with a locally installed version of Sandboxie!!<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;-- NOW packaged as an installer!! --&gt;<br>
<br>
SandboxiePortable now uses the official Sandboxie installer.  This has several benefits.  Installation is now much simpler, you don't have to manually extract anything.  Since the installer cleans up everything upon removal, you can now use the shell / sendto extensions portably.<br>
<br>
I've also included an Updater utility to simplify updating to a new version of Sandboxie.  It is located in the same directory as the launcher.  A separate download link is below for users who do not need to update the whole package.  Place the Updater in the same directory as the launcher.<br>
<br>
<br>
** NOTE TO USERS UPGRADING FROM 3.01.21 or 3.02 -<br>
<br>
The new GUI versions of Sandboxie use a new layout for the INI file.  DO NOT use your old INI file directly with this new portable version of Sandboxie.  Run the launcher once and let it copy a default INI to the application directory, then modify your settings via the GUI.<br>

				<div class="content">Hmm, not sure if you should keep turning the server on and off like that, cause someone may then need the file but won't be able to download it until maybe 8 hours later.... <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> But other than that, nice job keeping the portable version active, for a while there I thought you had quit updating the portable version. Btw, I closed the old thread to keep all new posts in this new thread, hope you don't mind....</div>

<br>
I don't want my old laptop to die <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink">  I don't think it could handle 24/7 for very long.  I use it for a few other things during the week, which is why it's on.  If it doesn't work out I can always go back to the public hosts.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I haven't quit on the portable version, I just didn't have any improvements to make <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
EDIT - Thanks for that program.  I searched for like an hour and no luck.  Anyways, I think I'll be ok.  Seems I had a rogue Sandboxie.ini in my path that was screwing up my testing.  So the NSIS INI functions DO work on unicode files.  I can't search and replace in unicode though, which is what I originally wanted to do, but I can just delete the whole User section, and rewrite a minimal default.  It will only effect the first run on a new INI.  As soon as tzuk gets the next beta up, I should have a launcher ready for testing.</div>

				<div class="content">wraithdu, i could offer some space on my domain to host the files and perhaps create an ftp-account for you (have to check with my hoster if i can add more accounts, though).<br>

				<div class="content">I guess this has come up before but I can't find the answer in the other 22 pages thread <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>
<br>
How do I use my registration with the portable version?<br>
Yesterday I started SandboxiePortable from my USB drive for the first time on my notebook at home and added my key. After I shut the portable version down and restarted it, it remembered this setting.<br>
Today I used the same on my work-computer, but Sandboxie wasn't registered anymore until I once again added the key.<br>
<br>
Do I miss something or is the key stored in a registry hive that isn't backed up by the launcher? But what's odd is that I compared regshots from my work-computer and couldn't find anything.<br>
<br>
<br>
@wraithdu: if there's a way to make this work without adding the registration-key on every computer I start the portable version on, this should be added to the readme.</div>

<br>
Sandboxie's license only allows you to register it on computers that you own.  To comply with the license (which you agree to by downloading and using the portable launcher) SandboxiePortable will not extract/backup/restore any license information.<br>
<br>
Though it was talked about, there is not yet any portable licensing available or planned.<br>

(Again, thank you so much for the webspace, it's very generous of you.  I like your music too!!)</div>

OK, didn't think about that.. just to clear myself <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"> - trying it on my work-machine was just a test of the portable, I don't intend to use the regged version on any other computer than my personal gear.<br>

You're welcome, I like to participate on cool projects in some way.. that includes Sandboxie itself and of course any portable app on the planet <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>
<br>
And thank you.. more to come, the current downloads range from 2002-2006, the new tracks will be on an EP or LP which hopefully is ready at the beginning of next year.<br>
<br>
<br>
[edit]one FR for the portable -&gt; could you add an ini with the disablesplash option in the next version?  It's only cause I always disable the splashes on any app, even the portables <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink">[/edit]</div>

This is a question about Sandboxie, not the portable launcher.  Could a mod please move the above post to the correct forum?  Thanks!<br>
<br>
@RAW<br>
Yeah, I can do that.<br>
