				<h3>Exclude sandboxed process from specific user accounts</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sat Feb 12, 2011 11:30 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>is_m00nbl00d</strong></div>
				<div class="content">As an example, I'll explain how I use my web browser in two different accounts.<br>
<br>
In account <strong>A</strong>, which I use for general web browsing, I have a browser profile, which for this purpose I'll be calling <strong>Profile A</strong>. The path is %ProgramFiles%\Web Browser\Profile A. (There are other profiles, but not used in this account.)<br>
<br>
This profile is being forced to run sandboxed in its own sandbox.<br>
<br>
In account <strong>B</strong>, I have two web browser profiles that I use, one being <strong>Profile A</strong> and the other <strong>Profile B</strong>. Obviously, <strong>Profile A</strong> is the same in both accounts, except that user data is written to different paths, in each respective account, and each one with different settings.<br>
I'd like to keep <strong>Profile A</strong> sandboxed for account <strong>A</strong>, but not for account <strong>B</strong>.<br>
<br>
I know I can manually run it sandboxed, but it would be nice if it would be possible to predefine it in Sandboxie sandboxes settings. Unless, I've missed some setting, I don't believe such is possible?<br>
<br>
Resuming:<br>
<br>
1. Run application A sandboxed in account A<br>
2. Do not run application A sandboxed in account B, etc<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you</div>
