This is old link where you could buy lifetime license. Not sure if you still can. The question is on how many PC you own this license can be simultaneously used?</div></blockquote>
Nice, thank you Dun!<br>
Three moths ago I also found a link but without a product in it. Don't remember if it was the same link but it's the same as the promotion in May (<a href="viewtopicc98bc98b.php?f=17&amp;t=18878&amp;start=15" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 8&amp;start=15</a>) So seems good.<br>
<br>
I'll be on vacation soon. The license key is written down in the received E-Mail, or? Or how long will take the shipment?</div>

When I received my license was via email.<br>
Actually, after looking at this lifetime promo I decided to purchase another lifetime license just for the mere taste of having another one. This precious and priceless program should be supported by any means.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>

Dunno, maybe they reactivated it (or never really deactivated) who knows <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
<br>
Yep, first you should get purchase confirmation e-mail. Later 10-15 minutes you should get your license key. Please tell me if you activate this license on more than one PC</div>

I am about to purchase another Lifetime license according to this link:<br>
<a href="https://www.cleverbridge.com/296/?scope=checkout&amp;cart=28154&amp;coupon=GJP-TBR-BL5" class="postlink">https://www.cleverbridge.com/296/?scope ... JP-TBR-BL5</a><br>
<br>
Is this still valid? If so can I activate Sanboxie on every computer I own? In other words the license terms are still same as the ones when Tzuk owned his firm?<br>
<br>
TIA<br>
<br>
Ed. When I mean to say "about to purchase" is that I have that page open and filled in... <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>

I got it!<br>
And it is working for at least one PC. After registration I got a pop-up window which informed me, I need to reactivate it in 180 days and that key is not time limited.<br>
<br>
I need to setup the second PC, where I want to use it. Will write as soon as possible if it is working.</div>

				<div class="content">Sorry but I don't feel confident purchasing the license from that link. How do we know they will honor these purchases? If Tzuk was still running the show I wouldn't have doubts. To be on the safe side I'd rather wait for an official response from Invincea.<br>
<br>
You'd think if they were offering this kind of deal it'll be plastered all over the front page and announced everywhere. Perhaps they'll make an official statement in the coming weeks to Christmas and New Years and introduce this as a special sale but until then I will hold off.<br>
<br>
I've been burnt too many times purchasing lifetime licenses (where they weren't honored) it has left a bad taste in my mouth.</div>

A program which was one of the main reasons to get the full version of SB don't work anymore (since last week or so) <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br>

Three weeks ago I canceled my credit card because didn't need it anymore. And what happened two weeks later? SB lifetime license available again! I lucky managed to get fast a new credit card only for SB.<br>

off-topic, nobody interested in but I felt impressed to write it.^^</div>

On the contrary, I am, sometimes we feel frustration on such things but believe me, Invincea's team is going to resolve it... <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>
