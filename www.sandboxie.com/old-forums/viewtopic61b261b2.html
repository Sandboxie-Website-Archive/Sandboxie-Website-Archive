				<div class="content">Hi, at some point in the last week I copied a jpeg into defaultbox for upload, but couldn't upload it because the file size in defaultbox was 0kb. Another time I downloaded a pdf but quick recovery didn't offer to recover the download, and I couldn't open it in the sandbox because the file size was 0kb. I've downloaded some programs ok in sandboxie, but these are the only files I've worked with so far.<br>
<br>
What's the cause? What do I need to do? Any links about this I can read up on? Thanks</div>

				<div class="content">Hello FrankieW,<br>
<br>
The files need to be at least 1kb for Sandboxie to recover them.  If you have 0kb files inside the Sandbox, you can manually recover them by copy-pasting them to the desired location as needed. <br>
<br>
Regarding the upload comment, I am not sure what are you doing exactly, but you can manually copy 0kb files into Sandboxie using Windows Explorer Sandboxed. <br>
<br>
More info about Recovery settings can be found below:<br>

<br>
Regarding the upload, maybe the problem was I copied and pasted into Sandboxie using windows explorer unsandboxed. Next time I will copy and paste into Sandboxie using windows explorer sandboxed. Thanks,<br>
