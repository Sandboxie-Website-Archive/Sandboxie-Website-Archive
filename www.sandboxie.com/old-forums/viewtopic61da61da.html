I want to use Thunderbird with sandboxie. The mailbox folders are on an other partition. When I want to add the folder Sandboxie says:<br>
an alternative folder should contain localstore.rtf.<br>
<br>
There is no localstore.rdf in my mailboxfolder and Mozilla says localstore.rtf ist deprecated<br>
<br>
<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Localstore.rdf" class="postlink">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Localstore.rdf</a><br>
<br>
xulstore.json (new) is in the profilefolder, not in the mailboxfolder.<br>
<br>
what can I/ you  do?<br>

				<div class="content">What you can try is to add the new path for your thunderbird install to the sandboxie.ini configuration.<br>
In the sandboxie control window choose "edit configuration" in the "configure" menu.<br>
Copy the template settings below and paste it after your [usersettings] (replace the "D:\mail\Thunerbird\Data\profile" with your path to the thunderbird profile folder)<br>
<br>
[TemplateSettings]<br>
<br>
Tmpl.Thunderbird=D:\mail\Thunerbird\Data\profile<br>
<br>
save the sandboxie.ini file and reload the configuration in the "configure" menu.<br>

				<div class="content">What I would suggest is that you create a new empty file named "localstore.rtf" in the Thunderbird profile folder - as long as you are sure that you have the correct folder.<br>
It should contain files like prefs.js, extensions.ini, abook.mab, cert8.db<br>
<br>
After Sandboxie accepts the folder as a valid Thunderbird profile folder, you can always go back and delete the localstore.rtf file that you created, or just leave it there.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi!<br>
Thank you all for your suggestions.<br>
<br>
They where useful for me thinking.<br>
<br>
I did find out, that sandboxie does not ask for the mailboxfolder, it asks for the profilefolder and the path <br>
<br>
%Local AppData%\Thunderbird<br>
<br>
seems not to work for me i think .... there were a lot of errormessages ...<br>
<br>
C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\xxxxxx.default (i did select) did work.<br>
<br>
After i cleaned  my inbox and compressed it (from 500MB to 4, errormessages)  it seemed  to work.<br>
<br>
I have to investigate it further the next days.<br>

				<div class="content">Hi!<br>
<br>
No - my Thunderbildinstallation does not work with sandboxie. Sandboxie wants the folder defined where localstore.rdf is in. That is the profilefolder on a SSD  and i can see files with datestamps of the time i was working with TB. <br>
<br>
But my mailboxes are an another partition on a HDD. When I send and receive emails with TB they disappear after restart.<br>
<br>
So I had to define 2 folders but this is not possible.<br>
