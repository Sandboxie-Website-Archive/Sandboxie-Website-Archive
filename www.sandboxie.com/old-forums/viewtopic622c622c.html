				<h3>Block screen capture :</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi there.<br>
I'm a registred user of sandboxie for some years now and i'm using the block process access dll too.<br>
I've locked my files and partitions so that sandboxed apps can't get to them and also block internet access and create diferent sandboxes for different apps so that any app that i have actual internet access on my computer (like IE, SKYPE, etc) have it's own sandbox with it's own rules about what it can access and what can be executed inside that sandbox, etc, and i feel way more protected and secure by now that i would never ever execute IE outside sandboxie except for the windows update.<br>
Yet i've found a potential problem.<br>
Apps like Skype or VNC allow for the app to take a screen capture (or several) or have direct access to the screen. <br>
This can be a problem if, for instance, a bug is found on skype that allows leakage of that screen shots / screen sharing or if some software with that capability is installed under the sandbox. Even with a safe system, where all the files are locked and all internet apps are inside a sandbox, there this a possibility of screen captures to be made and send to 3rd party. I run my skype for several hours a day, and i'm confident that even if there are any bug on skype that will allow a 3rd party access to my system, they will not get to any files, neither the microphone that i allways un-plug while not on use, but there is yet the margin for the screen to be spyed on, and that can be a problem if you open a truecrypt volume with your secret passwords for all of your sites, or any other confidential stuff.<br>
Sam is true if some malware is bundle with that hability and manage to be installed on a sandbox.<br>
My request would be for an option that would block screen captures and screen sharing from inside the sandbox, so that apps like VNC or skype wouldn't be able to capture your screen under sandbox, <br>
Thanks for the attention taken,<br>
Alexandre.</div>

				<div class="content">Why legitimate separate from criminal activity? The option to apply for each program running in the sandbox.<br>
Something else. Kaspersky has something great: When a program creates a screenshot, the screen is completely black. It's just for a couple milliseconds, it's not like it disturbs.</div>

The idea is for example not allow to an app out of a list that you can determine to do certain actions, capture keystrokes, screencapture....</div>
