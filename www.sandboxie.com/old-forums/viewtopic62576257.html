				<div class="content">After a recent reinstall, I'm no longer able to activate Sandboxie.  It is telling me the product key was activated on too many computers.  I have the product installed on my laptop right now which connects on my wireless at work and here at home and no where else.  There should only be a couple ips that the activations came from.  Is there anyway I can either get a new key or have the activation re-enabled?  If I need to pay for an additional license for using it on the work network, I would be willing to do that, but I do need some reassurance I won't run into the issue any time soon.<br>
<br>
Thanks</div>
