Yes this is a bug. Should be fixed in 5.15.5 or perhaps 5.15.6.</div>

Killing SP in the sandbox unfreezes Firefox. That's on v 50 BTW - now updated to the beta channel again. Outside a sandbox I get no freezes.</div></blockquote>
Gone back to 5.14</div></blockquote>
And no FF freezes or Sticky Password crashes for a while. Also updated to FF51b1 and that seems ok with 5.14. May try 5.15.5, but no longer feel quite the imperative to upgrade now using release version of Windows instead of Preview Builds.</div>

Thanks, it helped launch <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
But as already mention earlier by many users, process Steam Client Bootstrapper.exe each time eat around 10-15% of cpu. For example - Launching 2 x steam usage because of this process going up to 20+% <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br>
