				<div class="content">After having used Sandboxie for around 3 years, with WinXP Corporate 32-bit<br>
and now with Win7 Ultimate 64-bit, I decided it was time for me to finally<br>
contribute some supporting funds to the project, to help ensure continued<br>
development efforts.<br>
<br>
I will admit to having installed a 'cracked' version under XP x86, and it worked<br>
extremely well for my purposes. I was also very poor at the time, although<br>
this is hardly an acceptable excuse. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed"> <br>
<br>
I am very glad to now be in a better financial position, being able to support<br>
such projects as they benefit my own needs and uses. Sandboxie is an invaluable<br>
tool for people like me, who frequently download such programs as casual games<br>
which are often loaded with unwanted garbage like browser toolbars and the like.<br>
SBIE makes it very trouble-free for me to try out and enjoy such programs<br>
without them adding a bunch of additional garbage to my system, and equally<br>
trouble-free for me to delete them when I'm done with them.</div>
