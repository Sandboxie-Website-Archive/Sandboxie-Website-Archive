				<h3>folders hidden on Sandboxed USB</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sat Apr 15, 2017 8:22 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I am running the latest version Sandboxie on my new HP PC running Windows10.  <br>
<br>
I had been using an old version on a Compaq that crashed and died to write rtf files on a usb drive that I ran Sandboxed.<br>
When I did, I would open a folder that was only visible when I ran the USB Sandboxed.<br>
<br>
I was hoping that I could get at that folder by opening that USB Sandboxed on my new computer but the folder is not showing.<br>
<br>
There must be a way of getting at my lost files but I haven't been able to figure out how on my own.<br>
Could somebody please let me know what I need to do?</div>

<br>
When using Sandboxie, you are not making any modifications the host (drive). So, unless you specifically open a path or recover the files, they will remain inside the sandbox (until either deleted or recovered).<br>
If the folder was created with Sandboxie, then it will be located in your Sandbox location --&gt; Sandbox Name --&gt; Drive --&gt; Whatever letter was used for your USB.<br>
<br>

				<div class="content">If I understand correctly, you're saying that when I ran the USB (let's say E:) sandboxed, the data was saved in the sandbox, which I assume would be on the hard drive (C:) in the My Documents folder.  If I copy the My Documents folder from the hard disk of the defunct computer and transfer it to the same folder on my new computer, do I then have access to the sandbox that I was using before?  Or is it more complicated than that?  (I never noticed anything about sandboxing when looking at that folder.)</div>

<br>
Unless you have changed the container folder location, Sandboxie creates a "Sandbox" folder on the C: drive (by default).  <br>
You will have to access that folder (in your old pc)  in order to find your files (provided you did not empty the contents of your Sandbox or recovered them) . <br>
<br>
Here's an example of what you might see:<br>
C:\Sandbox\USERNAME\SANDBOXNAME\drive   <br>
