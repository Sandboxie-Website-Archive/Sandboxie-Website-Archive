				<div class="content">Hi Tzuk,<br>
<br>
I just did a clean XPPro SP2 Windows install.  I have a previous version of Sandboxie (v2.45-registered) - however, I decided to try the latest release (v2.49).  <br>
<br>
I set the Automatic Sandbox Clean-Up option to: When Sandboxie Closes.  The automatic feature will not run - however, I can still delete and recover files manually.<br>
<br>
I uninstalled v2.49 and reinstalled v2.45.  No change.  This feature did work with my previous installation.<br>
<br>
Other programs running:<br>
<br>
ZoneAlarm Free v6.5.731 - latest.  Note-this is a later version than I was using previously.  Perhaps this could be the problem?<br>
<br>
AVG Free v7.1.394<br>
<br>
Spyware Blaster v3.5.1<br>
<br>
There are no other memory-resident programs.<br>
<br>
Other programs: <br>
<br>
Registry Mechanic<br>
A-Squared Free (not memory-resident)<br>
Ad-Aware SE Personal<br>
<br>
Please let me know if you have any ideas?  Thanks.<br>
<br>
I always feel safer surfing with Sandboxie.<br>
<br>

				<div class="content">Has anything else changed?  Do you have the same sandbox top level folder as before, for example?<br>
<br>
Also, does automatic clean up work, when you set it to when-last-program-ends?</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Tzuk,<br>
<br>
Sorry I got this message in the wrong forum - and thanks for answering anyway.<br>
<br>
I changed the cleanup option to: When Last Program Ends - and the Automatic cleanup feature now works.  <br>
<br>
I did not understand what the Top Level Folder was about - so I never made any changes to it.<br>
<br>
I hope it is okay to change the subject.  I had the issue with the Qurb anti-spam program.  There was one additional issue - outside of Sandboxie, Qurb automatically moves the emails which do not have matching addresses to the Qurb folder.  Inside of Sandboxie, I get a pop-up asking me where to place the messages.  <br>
<br>
I can easily do this manually - however, if you do have any ideas as to what the problem might be, I would be thankful.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for your help.<br>
Alan</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Alan, I tested the cleanup thing today.  It does work, at least for me, but I noticed a "little known feature"  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"><br>
<br>
If Sandboxie is configured to "Auto Delete When Sandboxie Closes", and there are any recoverable files in the folders listed for Quick Recovery, then auto-clean <em>will not occur</em>.<br>
<br>
For some reason -- I can't for the life of me remember what was I thinking -- recoverable items are not checked when "Auto Clean When Last Program Ends".  In this mode, the sandbox is always deleted.<br>
<br>
It would probably make more sense the other way around ... But changing this will have to wait for another day. <br>
<br>
Anyway -- perhaps this was your problem.  Try reverting to "Auto Delete When Sandboxie Closes" now that your Quick Recovery folders are empty, and see if that makes a difference for you.<br>

I'll have to look into this and see what's confusing Qurb.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Tzuk,<br>
<br>
I tried the "When Sandboxie Closes" option - and for me it still does NOT clean out the Sandbox.  Since it does work with the "When Last Program Ends" option, I will just continue to use that.<br>
<br>
Also - I should point out that with my previous XP setup, the "When Sandboxie Closes" option DID work correctly all the time - even if there were files to be recovered.  In fact, if I remember correctly, the "When Last Program Ends" option would not clean the Sandbox - just the opposite of what is happening now.<br>
<br>
That is why I tried to reinstall the older Sandboxie version to see if it would start working - but perhaps some components were still in the system from the new version and prevented it from working correctly.<br>
<br>
Hope you can find out what is going on with these 2 options.<br>
<br>
Question - I have File Sharing and several of the system services (services.msc) turned off/disabled.  Does Sandboxie need any system settings to be on/enabled to work correctly?<br>
<br>
Thanks for your quick reply.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
Alan</div>

No, it doesn't need any of those.<br>
<br>
Sandboxie doesn't use any services that aren't already required by Windows itself.</div>
