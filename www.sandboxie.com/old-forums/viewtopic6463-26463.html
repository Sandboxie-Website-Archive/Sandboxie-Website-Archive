<br>
according to this Sandboxie 4.04 fails to protect against these malware samples.<br>
I have to admit I'm very suspicious about this, because Sandboxie fails to protect against too many malware samples.<br>
If someone else on board has already tested Sandboxie, I'm sure the answer would be that Sandboxie 4.04 did not fail against malware samples.<br>
Big thanks.</div>

<br>
First time the computer is scanned, Hitman Pro finds malware samples in sandbox folder and in the folder where malwares used for testing are stored.<br>
<br>
Sandbox folder and folder containing malwares are removed.<br>
<br>
Second time the computer is scanned, Hitman Pro finds nothing.<br>
<br>
What is the problem?</div>

				<div class="content">I am not sure of the point the video is making, but if it is that Sandboxie failed then there is a lack of understanding of Sandboxie<br>
<br>
Couple of points.<br>
<br>
1.  Sandboxie does nothing to identify malware or whether a program is good or bad.<br>
<br>
2.  Unless run exclusions are in place, Sandboxie does nothing to prevent anything from runninig.<br>
<br>
3.  What Sandboxie does admirably well is prevent malware that does run from infecting the system.<br>
<br>
<br>
No. 3 is the key.<br>

No problem at all, but how could I miss it?<br>
I wasn't paying attention too much, so obviously I have not seen this video very good.</div>

				<div class="content">If all those malware samples were actually running in the real system it would seem to me your computer would become infected and possibly you might not even be able to finish conducting this test depending upon what the malware would actually do when running on your system.<br>
<br>
Those malware samples were "CONTAINED" in the sandbox and once the sandbox is deleted they are gone. If you "RECOVERED" those malware samples "OUT OF THE SANDBOX" then your computer would become infected.</div>

I don't take any youtube reviews seriously.  Why didn't he simply report it here.<br>
