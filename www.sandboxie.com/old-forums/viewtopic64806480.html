				<h3>Invincea X New Endpoint Security ...What about Sandboxie?</h3>

				<div class="content">As for Sandboxie (the container, isolation..) it's very much alive. <br>
The container is still a part of the Invincea Core product. It's a layer, It's a part of the overall product, Invincea is not focusing on technology we know that works, It's now about the new tech that will supercharge that. Unfortunately, others who have attempted <strong><em>and failed</em></strong> in Sanboxing (Bromium, Kaspersky and others) have sullied the Sandboxie the waters. Thus, Enterprise doesn't like the "container" word because of these failures. <br>
 <br>

<strong>X by Invincea is Enterprise / Government focused</strong></span>.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>""AV-TEST, an independent organization that evaluates and rates antivirus and security suite software, recently completed a private test of X by Invincea.<strong> X by Invincea outperformed other endpoint protection products</strong>, ranking higher than Cylance and SentinelOne, who were evaluated in prior tests using the same methodology.<br>
<br>
“In a recent AV-TEST endpoint protection test, Invincea scored high marks for performance and protection,” said Maik Morgenstern, CTO, AV-TEST. “For performance, Invincea had one of the best scores we have ever seen in our tests to date. And, for protection, Invincea blocked 100% of attacks from 64 malicious websites. No other signature-less endpoint protection product provided 100% detection and blocking for this category in previous tests.”</div></blockquote>
