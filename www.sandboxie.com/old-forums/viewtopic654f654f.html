				<div class="content"><strong>I would like to think that the makers of Sandboxie would continue to consider that out of its millions of users, there probably are a significant number of people who are living on hard times and can't afford to spend money on software. This, or course, certainly does not mean that such users are ungreatful to the makers of Sandboxie for this outstanding program. Rather, I think most people know that there are people all over in different financial situations. In saying all of this, I am not grovelling or complaining, but just asking and hoping for the sake of others and myself that the free version of Sandboxie survives.<br>

Amen to that. <br>
I have three lifetime licenses myself but I agree that the free version should remain,<br>
regardless of what other forms of paid versions come along.
