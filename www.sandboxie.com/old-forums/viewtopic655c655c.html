				<div class="content">Basically, I've installed the last sandboxie version, aka 5.22<br>
I'm using Windows 10 64-bit Enterprise, my first time<br>
The anti-virus I have is the simple Windows Defender<br>
<br>
So, here's the deal. I always used Windows 7 64-bit Ultimate, sandboxie worked perfectly and no issues present.<br>
One day, I installed Windows 10, installed the programs I used to have. They all worked fine except for Sandboxie. It just doesn't work anymore.<br>
<br>
<br>
Whenever I try to open sandboxie, or open an application with sandboxie, the menu appears and instantly shuts as if there was something blocking it.<br>
It happens in a split second. You simply can't even read the contents of the menu which comes out. It just closes and nothing else happens<br>
<br>
According to a friend of mine on one of the gaming forums, the same issue happened to him. So what's up?<br>
<br>
PS: checked out firewall, no its not blocking the application</div>

				<div class="content">Hi xRemix, you should be able to run most programs that you ran sandboxed in W7 in W10. I am using same programs in both systems and running them sandboxed without issue.<br>
<br>
Important: What are the programs you are having issue running andboxed in W10?<br>
<br>
Be aware, Universal apps and Edge are not compatible with Sandboxie. So, you cant run this type of programs sandboxed.<br>
<br>
I updated a little while ago my W10 to 1709 16299.125, and all related to SBIE appears to be well.<br>
<br>
I got my W10 five months ago, I expected problems but to my joy, I have found none related to Sandboxie. You should be OK. Using WD instead of another SV is a good idea in W10.<br>

<br>
I'm simply trying to start a game using sandboxie in order to active two accounts in the same time. GTA San Andreas MultiPlayer<br>
its not a big deal really but it simply stopped working<br>
<br>
however, I think sandboxie does not work at all since I tried to open sandboxie without any files in sandboxie and it didnt work either</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I think sandboxie does not work at all since I tried to open sandboxie without any files in sandboxie and it didnt work either</div></blockquote>

Do you mean you tried opening Sandboxie Control? Or are you invoking a web browser? <br>
Please provide repro steps so that we can better assist you.<br>
<br>
Are there any errors related to Sandboxie in the Windows Event Viewer (Applications) ? <br>
Have you tried the latest beta?:<br>

				<div class="content">Sorry for the late reply, I have tried the latest beta but still, nothing.<br>
<br>
Yes, I was speaking about the sandboxie control, the sandboxie start menu or any applications through sandboxie.<br>
<br>
It just 'disappears' leaving no processes in the task manager.</div>

<br>
Are there any error messages in the Windows Event viewer? Maybe we can find what's going there? <br>
Do you have any applocker policies in place? Or any other application control settings enabled?<br>
What Firewall are you using? Can you turn it off , reboot, and see if that allows Sandboxie to launch? <br>
<br>
