				<div class="content">Hi Tzuk,<br>
<br>
I was wondering if you can include a 'sandbox settings' option under the submenu which belongs to each sandbox name which is listed on the trayicon menu. I don't know if this has been posted before, so forgive me if it has. It would be a nice perk that enables faster access to the settings box.</div>

				<div class="content">Well this has been suggested by people from time to time, but the last time I saw it suggested was like 3-4 years ago, I only remember tzuk not being too keen of the idea since you could just right click the sandbox in Sandboxie Control. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>

It was easy enough for me to find this thread, because I had seconded the idea at the time.<br>
Even after all this time, I still occasionally look for it there.</div>

Haha, same here! In fact a few months ago I had a brainfart and stared at the context menu for a minute wondering "Where is that Sandbox Settings entry?" and I was going nuts thinking my eyes were over-looking it or something, until I remembered it's only in the Sandboxie Control context menu. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>

				<div class="content">It would be pretty convenient. SnD and Guest good to know that I'm not the only one thinking of it. But I understand if it isn't added, I won't sweat it  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>
