				<div class="content">I've been using sandboxie  since 3.46 - all 64bit versions.  I recently upgraded to 4.02 from 3.76(life time registered user).  I use Strokeit with sandboxie, and NEVER had any problems from 3.46(64bit) ~ 3.76(64bit).  But on 4.02(64bit)  Strokeit doesn't work at all.  I've tried entering: <br>
<br>
 OpenWinClass=# <br>
 OpenWinClass=Strokeit<br>
<br>
in sandboxie.ini under default sandboxie with no success.<br>
<br>
I've fiddled and googled for over an hour and finally reverted back to 3.76. Strokeit works perfect in this version.   I like the newest version 4.02, b/c it seems snappier with browsers, but I CANNOT live without Strokeit(have too many settings set up). <br>
<br>
Is there a solution?  is sandboxie not going to be compatible with Strokeit even in the future??????<br>
<br>
I'm running Windows 7 ultimate 64bit.</div>

<br>
Do not user OpenWinClass=#<br>
Just try OpenWinClass=Strokeit <br>
<br>
Which I believe the new template for strokeit for the software compatibility of SB 4.02 does by default. <br>
This has gotten strokeit to work on most but not all my sandboxed applications on win7 64bit.<br>
<br>
<br>
A few questions:<br>
<br>
Does strokeIt not work on all sandboxed applications or just some?  <br>
<br>
Can you try opening a sandboxed notepad and try a gesture on that.  <br>
<br>
Also, I am having some problems with strokeit myself and would like to know if you are running strokeIT with admin privileges?</div>

				<div class="content">Since you will not be using OpenWinClass=#  which tells sandboxie not to modify the window class name.<br>
<br>
You will need to edit you strokeit configuration for window classes to use a pattern based match to recognize these sandboxed windows.<br>
<br>
Example old Window Class config for a application gesture:<br>
Chrome_WidgetWin_1<br>
This will just match unsandboxed windows.  It will not match Sandbox:Chrome:Chrome_WidgetWin_1<br>
<br>
Under Application Identifiers edit the entry and just check off match text as pattern and change the entry to the following to get it to match:<br>
*Chrome_WidgetWin_1<br>
<br>
I use: *Chrome_WidgetWin_? as sometimes the number changes.<br>

I have tested 4.03.01 and have the following to report on a Win7 64bit system:<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
In version 3.76 I ran StrokeIT as administrator so that it can interact with process explorer, computer management, etc, and this never had any issues on sandboxed applications.<br>
-----------<br>
In version 4.02, StrokeIT running as administrator failed to interact with a Sandboxed Chrome but worked on all other sandboxed apps (well i don't use other browser besides chrome so didnt test those as others report problems).  But when I ran StrokeIt without elevated privileges, it suddenly started to working with Sandboxed Chrome. I used this with the inconvenience of not being able to minimize gestures or other gestures on admin launched applications as I typically do.  And was awaiting your next beta version.  However, then I started to notice GUIPROXY_00000001 Error as found on the other thread <a href="../phpbb/viewtopiccaa7.php?t=15772" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=15772</a><br>
<br>
-----------<br>
Now, with version 4.03.01, StrokeIT running without elevated privileges, continue to work with chrome, but still have popups for GUIPROXY_00000001 Error.  Other than that it seems to function fine.<br>
<br>
So now I test StrokeIT launch as admin as this is how ideally I would like it to run, but just like 4.02, it doesn't register the stroke it blue line / gestures in chrome.  In fact, now it doesn't work on any sandbox applications, while in 4.02 it worked on every sandboxed application but chrome.  <br>
<br>
And then I test Stroke launch as admin and also with OpenWinClass=*, now it works on all sandboxed and unsanboxed applications, however I would have to add OpenWinClass to each sandbox which will decrease security quite a bit.  Also, I would like to note that with  OpenWinClass=* the GUIPROXY_00000001 Error dissappeared.<br>
----------<br>
<br>
Just wanted to report my finding and let you know that StrokeIt functions differently depending on how its launched.  I would appreciate it if you can get it to work when launched elevated as admin without having to resort to  OpenWinClass=*.<br>
<br>
By the way, when relaunching strokeIt as admin, you must first Shutdown strokeIt via the File Menu in the program, so it will properly unload the DLL's files or whatnot.  If strokeIt isn't shutdown this way then A/B testing admin/non-admin won't differ.</div>

<br>
Thanks for your work. Maxthon can work very well in SBie 4.03.02 with template of StrokeIt.<br>
<br>
In addition, the topic is still 4.03.01 <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>
