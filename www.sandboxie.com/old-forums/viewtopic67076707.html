I have nearly the same problem - all audio files: no sound, in my case video seams to work, but all without sound. All is ok outside the sandbox.</div>

				<div class="content">Tested 5.01.8 on my real Windows 7 x64 today, once again Skype had trouble with audio but instead of a blank list I saw this:<br>
<br>
Microphone<br>
{0.0.1.00000000}.{32dfff67-1c99<br>
Speakers<br>
{0.0.0.00000000}.{5c76cdef-c4dd<br>
<br>
checking with regedit shows they are related to my actual sound card and devices however only one area had the exact same string:<br>
HKEY_USERS\*S-I-D*\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\LowRegistry\Audio\PolicyConfig\PropertyStore\<br>
<br>
<br>
Update: <br>
Removing Skypes user data directory and clearing it's sandbox didn't help.<br>
I then tested it in a clean/updated Windows 7 x64 VM to rule out my other third party programs and had expected it to work but it had the same issue. Maybe it's OS specific and as you tested in 10 it didn't show up? Guess I'm installing 10 in a VM to test that theory next :P</div>

				<div class="content">Testing Skype in Windows 10 was a no go. Inside sandboxie the menu is missing. You can see it when it's on the 'connecting' phase but there is no way to get to the settings at that point. Once it's loaded the menu is gone and shortcuts like Alt+T don't work. It threw up a lot of errors like 'out of system resources' and 'parameter is incorrect' as well. I even tried 'run as administrator' - no change. Outside of sandboxie the menu was there and no issues. So basically I don't know if it has the same sound issue on Windows 10 as I couldn't get to the device selection after all but it certainly has other problems!</div>

Yes, This has not been fixed as of yet. When it is, it will be posted in the release change log. The font issue is system wide in Win10 using sbie. It shows up more in FF. But it can happen all over. Chrome is immune.</div>

The menu missing is related to the system wide font issue w/ Win10 and SBIE. A fix has not been issued as of yet. Chrome is the only program thus far that seems to be immune from weird font, pop windows, menus, etc issues.</div>

It's the known font issue that happens w/ Win 10 and SBIE. It has not been rectified as of yet. When it is, the details will be posted in the change log. Only what Curt puts in the change log reflects what has been addressed.</div>

Alright. I'll see if I can break it tomorrow. In testing we saw no issues. Of course, that's a clean Win install w/ the basics.</div>
