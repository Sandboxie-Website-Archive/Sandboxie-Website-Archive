				<div class="content">Hello simkein,<br>
<br>
To clarify, is this issue is also happening when you create a New Sandbox? If so, delete is not related to the problem.<br>
What are your OS, Antivirus and SBIE versions? <br>
Do you have Steam installed outside Sandboxie? Are you getting any error messages?<br>
<br>
Please try the following:<br>
Close all sessions of Steam<br>
Launch Steam outside Sandboxie and wait for it to update <br>
Close Steam<br>
Relaunch it and ensure that there are no more updates.<br>
Check the Version (Steam --&gt; Help --&gt; About Steam)<br>
Close Steam.<br>
<br>
Launch Steam in a new Sandbox as Administrator<br>
Check the Version and see if they  match.<br>
<br>
Let us know the results.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>

Yes, even with new sandbox problem is still there.<br>
Before every steam launch in sandbox I open it outside of sandbox to check for client or game updates.<br>
I'm using windows 10, no antivirus and sbie is 5.14.<br>
I also tried to install newer version, but outcome was the same.</div>

I am unable to reproduce this problem, need more info.<br>
What are the 2 Steam versions that you see? (Non-Sandboxed and Sandboxed). <br>
<br>
Please try updating to the latest stable version of Sandboxie;<br>

				<div class="content">Hi, i'm currently experiencing the same on the latest version of sandboxie and the latest update of steam. When i first launch steam it "updates" steam to the current version(already updated in main installation) then after a period of time(sometimes, not always) it pops up the notification to restart steam to update. Upon clicking this it promptly updates itself to the exact same version of steam...</div>

<br>
I re-tested and I am still unable to reproduce the issue.<br>
<br>
If the client is updated, what happens if you do not restart it when prompted to do so?  How long does it usually take for this pop-up to appear? <br>
Do you have exact steps to reproduce the problem? <br>
<br>
Please make sure to first run Steam outside Sbie, update it and relaunch it to ensure there are no further updates. Then, launch it inside the Sandbox (preferably a newly created one). <br>
<br>
Also, please try the latest beta:<br>

				<div class="content">Hi again barb, the prompt doesn't always appear, and when it does sometimes nothing happens and sometimes the Steam/game window just closes after a few minutes. The only consistent issue im seeing is the forced update on being open in sandboxie. I'm not sure what steps may have cause this because in the past it worked fine then one day i tried to launch some sandboxied steam clients and they all had to "update" which actually updates nothing. I have tried the steps you mentioned and it still "updates" when launched in SB.<br>
<br>
--------------- MERGED POST --------------- <br>
<br>
Sometimes it will force the client to close other times it wont do anything, anywher from 10 seconds to it never does. I'm not sure what steps are causing it because i haven't changed anything from when it was working. I've tried that it still updates when launched in SB.</div>

<br>
Unfortunately, this is not an issue we can reproduce (I  tested it again and I did not receive any update popups).<br>
<br>
Does it work fine when Steam is not Sandboxed? <br>
Please try creating a new sandbox or deleting contents of your current one.   <br>
<br>
If all fails, you may want to check the Steam forums for client update issues. See if you can refresh your Steam installation and test if that alleviates the issue. <br>

<br>
Are you deleting the contents of your Sandbox in between running Steam? <br>
Are you launching steam on the host first, to ensure updates go thru, then launching it Sandboxed? <br>
<br>
Any chance you are not properly closing Steam? You might want to have a look at this:<br>

				<div class="content">When the sandbox starts, Steam constantly unzips the update, then updates, and it takes a very long time.<br>
I tried to remove Steam - it does not help, I deleted the sandboxes-it does not help.<br>
What could be the problem?<br>
Previously, this also occurred when updating the client outside the sandbox, but after removing it all came back to normal.<br>
<br>
Now the launch of one sandbox on the HDD lasts up to 10 minutes, on SSD a bit faster, but the problem is in constant unzipping, rewriting and installing the Steam update, even if the client is running in the sandbox, the offer to update the Steam is popping up again. ..<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>When the sandbox starts, Steam constantly unzips the update</div></blockquote>
You mean when Sandboxie Ctrl launches? How are you reproducing the problem exactly?
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I tried to remove Steam - it does not help, I deleted the sandboxes-it does not help.</div></blockquote>
Is Steam installed inside Sandboxie? <br>
How are you deleting the sandboxes?  Via their folder location, or emptying the contents via Sandboxie Control?
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Previously, this also occurred when updating the client outside the sandbox, but after removing it all came back to normal.</div></blockquote>
So the issue happens on the host as well? <br>
<br>
Is there any antivirus software involved? <br>
Did you try the steps above your post, to switch compatibility mode? <br>
<br>
