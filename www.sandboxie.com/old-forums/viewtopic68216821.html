Thanks, Bo I have the same thoughts, it's a POC, it's alll just a pure hypothesis.<br>
I willy enjoy in my SBIE and its tight configuation, it's really worth it, but I wanted to ask you since my license in the next 3 months is coming to an end:<br>
I want to know should I protect my removable drives with something else?</div>

I do now understand that I need to update Chrome outside the sandbox, but isn't this the same case also with Firefox and IE?</div>

I think you are using an antivirus, right? If you are, the antivirus and forcing the removable drives is enough protection, in my opinion. As a  Sandboxie user, the best advice that I can give you, another Sandboxie user, is this: run most of your files and programs sandboxed and be extra careful about the ones that you run out of the sandbox and your computer is gonna be clean when you turn it off, every time. <br>

Sure, thanks. But there is a huuuge possibility that perhaps my antivirus is redundant:<br>

<br>
Plus, I also use application called NoAutorun-it automatically scans all of my removable drives, plus I can write-protect my usb so nothing can copy itself to my computer.<br>
What do you think?<br>
I use 0xFF option-Disables AutoRun on all kinds of drives-what do you think?</div>

				<div class="content">Updating anything in a sandbox is fundamental BAD practice, especially a browser. In fact my Chrome automatically FAILS when it tries to update within Sandboxie. If I  wish to update Chrome or any other browser, I do it UNSANDBOXED. Then it all goes like clockwork.<br>
<br>
Golden rule - NEVER update any program in a sandbox and that of course applies to using Sandboxie.</div>

				<div class="content">Guys, I fully support your attitude to not have anything updated while running it in a sandbox but I believe Chrome is actually running an updater outside the browser in the sandbox.<br>
I also run Firefox and know that every so often I need to run it unsandboxed to to update but Chrome updates without me doing anything about it.  I previously raised this issue here and Tsuk stated
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I think Chrome sometimes installs a Google Update service (running in the background, outside the sandbox). Probably that component is responsible for updating your Chrome</div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
I also note that on my system (Win 7/64 bit) using SB 4.06 pro - I have one sandbox configured to only allow three programs (IE, FF and Chrome) access to the net. Several times I noticed that chrome no longer worked in this sandbox, whereas in my main sandbox (allowing all programs to access the net), there was no problem. I then checked my program folder and found I had not only chrome.exe but also new_chrome.exe. I may be mistaken but my interpretation is that chrome upated and created a new exe file as I was already running chrome at the time. Only the existing chrome exe had permissiong to access the net inside my 2nd sandbox. Once I deleted the older chrome.exe and renamed the newer exe to just chrome.exe, everything went back to normal.<br>
<br>
Now this is my interpretation based on what I noticed - if someone has a better explanation, I would love to hear it.</div>

				<div class="content">I still don't understand what's this thread is about. You simply close and restart Chrome when you get notified about the update (i.e., the "settings" icon turns green). As said above, it's pretty damn impossible to miss, since after the update (which is done automatically in the background), no new tab actually works until you close Chrome and let the update finish. Google Update scheduled tasks run outside the sandbox.</div>

When I try to update my Chrome within Sandboxie, it fails. I have to update Chrome unsandboxed, then it goes OK.<br>
<br>
I have also had a big problem with updating Chrome extension Click &amp; Clean within Sandboxie. Caused a lot of hassle until I found that when I installed C&amp;C unsandboxed, it all went OK.<br>
<br>
I ALWAYS update and install outside of Sandboxie. That way, if there is any trouble at least Sandboxie is ruled out.</div>
