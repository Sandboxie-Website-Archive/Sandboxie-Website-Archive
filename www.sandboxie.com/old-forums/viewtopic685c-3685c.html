				<h3>4.09 Beta Available (Latest Version 4.10 Release Candidate)</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Wed Feb 19, 2014 2:01 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content"><a href="../indexd906.html?AllVersions" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?AllVersions</a><br>
<br>
<strong>Fixes in 4.10 RC</strong><br>
The Excel clipboard problem "The picture is too large and will be truncated." has been fixed. <br>
<br>
<strong>Fixes in 4.09.5</strong><br>
<br>
  In this beta, Sandboxie has been built under Visual Studio 2010 and uses newer versions of the Microsoft libraries.  Two new security features have been enabled for all Sandboxie binaries:  DEP (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/data-execution-prevention-frequently-asked-questions" class="postlink">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/wind ... -questions</a>)  and ASLR (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization" class="postlink">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_sp ... domization</a>) .<br>
<br>
<strong>Fixes in 4.9.4:</strong><br>
<br>
   Fixed the following startup errors on the Dell Venue and other Win 8.1 tablets.<br>
SBIE2336 Error in GUI server: [11 / C0000021] <br>
SBIE2335 Initialization failed for process Start.exe [88/0]<br>
<br>
<strong>Fixes in 4.9.3:</strong><br>
<br>
   This update is exclusively to fix Windows 8.1 update KB2919355.<br>
<br>
<strong>Fixes in 4.9.2:</strong><br>
<br>
   Fixed several additional C0000142 (STATUS_DLL_INIT_FAILED) bugs.  These could also show up as "CRT not initialized" or "DLL failed to initialize" errors and could also sometimes cause the sandboxed application to crash on start.<br>
<br>
<strong>Fixes in 4.9.1:</strong><br>
<br>
1) Incompatibility with FFX 27 and Avast that caused FFX to run with no visible windows.<br>
2) Chrome crash when reporting an issue under Tools-&gt;Report an issue...<br>
3) Fixed  a problem with DFS drives (Distributed File System)<br>
4) The "InjectDll" setting would sometimes cause DLL initialization to fail with the message "CRT not initialized" or "DLL failed to initialize".</div>

In what version was introduced the bug which causes DLL initialization to fail with the message "CRT not initialized" or "DLL failed to initialize"?<br>

Is the bug present since 4.01.01 beta version or it was introduced in later version?</div>

I thought the changes made to internal architecture caused that Sandboxie was not suitable for malware analysis anymore, but it could be possible that the bug you fixed in 4.09.01 was in fact the reason that caused some malwares to do not run properly.<br>
<br>
The question is I do not remember with what exact malware I noticed something was wrong with Sandboxie 4.x but I just made a small test with a malware sample set and analyses seem to be fine, just like the ones created with version 3.76.<br>
<br>
So the good news for BSA users is that very probably Sandboxie 4.09.01+ versions will be suitable for doing malware analysis.<br>
<br>
In order to improve Sandboxie´s stealthness I requested Ronen a feature. May I rescue the feature request and send it to you?</div>

Are you trying to run Visual Studio in the sandbox?  I would not be at all surprised if that does not work.  VS has very deep hooks into the OS -- especially when debugging.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  Here are tzuk's last comments on VS.  I agree completely.<br>

Do you mean this?<br>
<a href="../indexfb58-2.html?StartCommandLine" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?StartCommandLine</a><br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Stop Programs 

Terminate all programs running in a particular sandbox. Note that the request is transmitted to the Sandboxie service SbieSvc, which actually carries out the termination. 
  "C:\Program Files\Sandboxie\Start.exe"  /terminate
  "C:\Program Files\Sandboxie\Start.exe"  /box:TestBox  /terminate
  "C:\Program Files\Sandboxie\Start.exe"  /terminate_all


If the parameter /box:SandboxName is omitted, programs running in the default sandbox, DefaultBox, will be stopped. 

The form /terminate_all terminates all programs in all sandboxes. </code></pre></div></div>
