				<div class="content">I understand the need to change the License Agreement from lifetime to annual, but I'm not a big fan of having to pay each year. I'd prefer to see it handled like most other software, you pay an initial license fee for the current version. You're entitled to modification releases within that version. Upon release of a new version, you can choose to pay a discounted rate (existing customer) and upgrade to the new version. I'd also like you to consider offering a family license 3- 5 computers used within the same house hold.<br>

To be brutally frank, it doesn't matter what you or anyone else prefers.  Tzuk has made the policy and doesn't seem inclined right now to anything different. How many different times do people need to hear it again.</div>

You can't tell them "well shut up and deal with it" since they are free to vent that they're not happy with the new license scheme and want to find an alternative scheme where everyone is happy. It's like the government doing something we don't like so should we just "shut up and deal with it"?<br>
<br>
People who bought the lifetime license are generally fine with it since it's not exactly their problem. For people who do need to buy another copy, they will have problem with the new scheme since it's not exactly nice. I know several people who I recommended the software to them and they did buy it. Then after the new license change which I did not know, tried to convert some more remaining users who were on the fence. Well... now they clearly rejected it and refuse to buy it.<br>
