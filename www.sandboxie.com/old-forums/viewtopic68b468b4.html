				<h3>Closing Down Individual Browser Tabs</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi Sandboxie Team<br>
<br>
This "relatively" simple idea has been bouncing around by brain for a few days now and, I thought, may prove useful for the wider Sandboxie community.<br>
<br>
When browsing the Internet with my sandboxed browser, I have found that sometimes my browser gets high-jacked by a rogue program that opens a new browser tab, takes control of the entire browser, cannot be exited, deleted or moved away from unless this program's download is triggered.<br>
<br>
With sandboxie, I click the "Terminate All Programs" menu option and put an end to this nonsense but I do have to start my browsing all over again. I was wondering if it is possible that Sandboxie can be updated with an additional feature, i.e. "Terminate Tab x" where X is a number counting from left to right, while still keeping "Terminate All Programs" as a final option.<br>
<br>
In other words, give Sandboxie an additional ability to terminate a specific browser tab without closing down the entire browser or browsing session.<br>
<br>
I do not know how difficult this will be, judging by the number of available browsers out there, or whether my idea has any merit but I hope someone can spend 5 or so minutes looking at it.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
You can close the program that affects your browser by selecting it via Sbie Control and choosing the "Terminate program" option.<br>
Another approach would be to restrict your Sandbox so that only allowed programs can Start:<br>
