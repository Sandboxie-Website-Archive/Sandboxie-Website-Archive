				<div class="content">I using Sandboxie for running an alt Steam account like for 4 years  and never had any problems, but after last Steam Client update got some troubles. Now I can't get access to any page through Steam Client except Library. Not to Store, Community, Profile etc, it's just loading forever and show black screen in Steam Client as result. If I run the same Steam Client outside of Sandboxie then it's works properly. Also Big Picture mode in Sandboxie works without any prob.<br>
Anyone have similar troubles or any thoughts what problem it can be?<br>
Windows 7 x64 Pro, Sandboxie 3.46 x64</div>

				<div class="content">It's possible that the Steam update broke something w/ that version (very old) of SBIE. You can try the newest version of SBIE, but we cannot confirm that all games will work. As that is impossible.</div>

				<div class="content">I have installed last version of Sandboxie but problem is still there. And probably I wasn't enough clear. This is not about I can't playing an game in sandbox, this is about I can't get access to any page in Steam client</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, because Sandboxie has been broken by Windows update. Please read the announcement regarding a temp work around. A fix is not yet permanent</div>

				<div class="content">We know the Steam client worked before the lasted update. We don't know if STEAM has updated their side in response. They may have, we have not been able to test Steam recently given the priority of the Windows Patch Tuesday. Again, we would also need more information related to your post, click here for what we require information wise. <br>

				<div class="content">It will be looked at next week, there is no ETA. We do know that the client works, but some games may not. Please see this post on what we may need. <a href="viewtopic633b633b.html?f=11&amp;t=19746" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 11&amp;t=19746</a><br>
<br>
Log files, dumps, error codes as well. <br>
<br>
If the games need a driver to install, then they will not work with SBIE. The game / driver would have to be first installed on your host machine, then to see if the game will work. I'll repeat, not all games may work, SBIE is not a VM Environment.</div>
