<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Fool malicious write operations by using Sandboxie. By creating a buffer between your protected application and your physical drive, read operations pass from the drive to the sandbox and then to the app. Write operations get as far as the sandbox, and stay there. The drive never gets anything written to it as long as Sandboxie is protecting the program (you'll know it is because the title bar will be enclosed by [#] ). It's extremely powerful, and it's wicked easy on your system resources (about 8mb ram, 1% CPU, and 1.2mb disk space).</div></blockquote>

I can't believe I waited so long to try Sandboxie...It's so insanely great, and there's really no other free software that does what it does.</div></blockquote></div>
