<br>
You should probably contact Baidu and get this false positive resolved with them so nothing is flagged.</div>

<br>
Thanks for the info. We try to reach out to these companies but most of the times, either the captcha doesn't work (like for Baidu), or they close the requests.<br>
<br>
To ensure you have downloaded a valid file, please see this:<br>

				<div class="content">You should be using SHA256 or SHA512 for file hash authentication, not SHA1 or MD5.  <br>
<br>
MD5 is extremely weak and can be forged with an investment of about $40K (probably less now as I read that a few years ago).<br>
<br>
Google warned several years ago that SHA1 is weak as well, and could probably be compromised by a large corporation (such as Google themselves) or a state actor:<br>

<br>
Of course any old hash will likely protect you from random errors in the download due to equipment or software problems, but as far as authenticating they're genuine against an adversary - yeah you need to be using SHA256 or SHA512.</div>
