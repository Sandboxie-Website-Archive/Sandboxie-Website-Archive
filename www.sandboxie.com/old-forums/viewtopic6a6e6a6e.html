				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
I don't get the SBIE2203 message with IE11 nor Chrome, but I do get it with Opera and Epic. Wonder how to fix it. (I might have done that before with Chrome [not sure if it also happened when beginning to use that browser, I don't remember] but don't know how too do it with Opera -which I just installed- and Epic which I have been using sporadically for some time.)<br>
<br>
If I get Opera to work without getting the SBIE2203 message, I might make Opera my default browser and ditch Chrome.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello  Lode,<br>
<br>
Is this the same issue that you reported here?: <br>
<a href="viewtopic9a219a21.php?f=11&amp;t=23997&amp;p=126272&amp;hilit=epic+browser#p126272" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... er#p126272</a><br>
<br>
What's the full error message? And what are your OS, Sandboxie and Antivirus versions? <br>
Have you tried deleting the contents of your Sandbox and/or creating a new one to see if the issue occurs there too? <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>

I'm using Sandboxie 5.16.<br>
<br>
I had removed everything having to do with Opera in the Sandboxie settings, and then added it all again. (The same settings I have for IE11 and Chrome.) But still SBIE2203 would appear. <br>
I also revisited the other thread. It tuns out that this is the situation with Alert3 now:<br>
<br>
With IE11 I can have full Alert3 protection enabled -Safe browsing and Exploit mitigation- and the panel with this following line 6x repeated does not appear when surfing sandboxed: "SBIE2203 Failed to communicate with Sandboxie Service:  *GUIPROXY_00000001 - opera.exe [FF000000]"<br>
So Sandboxie, IE11, and Alert3 are completely compatible.<br>
<br>
With Chrome I can leave Safe browsing enabled in Alert3, but not Exploit mitigation. Otherwise SBIE2203 appears.<br>
With Epic SBIE2203 appears unless I have Safe browsing -except for Keystroke Encryption- and Exploit mitigation disabled  in Alert3. <br>
Same with Opera: only Keystroke Encryption enabled.<br>
<br>
 (I removed Firefox already some time ago and replaced it with Chrome.)<br>
<br>
I can have all Alert3 options enabled for Chrome, Opera and Epic, but only by disabling sandboxing. I prefer to keep sandboxing enabled for them.  <br>
So I'm fine with this situation as it is now: full Sandboxie protection for all my browsers, and some options disabled in Alert3 for Chrome, Opera, and Epic. And thus no more SBIE2203 messages.   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>
