You can try to workaround your issue by changing Sandbox content level in Firefox. Open about:config, search for "security.sandbox.content.level" and change it from 3 to 2, or 1. or 0.<br>
<br>
You could also try disabling Multiprocess in Firefox. Open about:config, search for "browser.tabs.remote.autostart", and change it to false.<br>

Does the issue follow you to a new Sandbox with default settings? <br>
Is there any antivirus software involved? <br>

I tested videos on youtube.com using security.sandbox.content.level 3 on a clean profile with Firefox 57 64-bit on Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit and Sandboxie 5.22 64-bit. I don't see any buffering issues with Firefox and Sandboxie as you report which can be related to other things but I do notice the videos being sluggish with slight delayed pauses. All runs smooth on security.sandbox.content.level 2 with sound working.</div>

				<div class="content">Same issue with me, version 57.0 (64 bit) and SBIE ver 5.22 (64 bit), Win 7<br>
YouTube works with sound outside Sandboxie, but no sound inside.<br>
<br>
I've reinstalled Firefox three times and Sandboxie once. <br>
<br>
I had a miraculous fix that lasted about an hour, simply by deleting all history in FF (outside Sandboxie), deleting the Sandboxie folder at the C:/ directory.  For no known reason, sound disappeared again... and none of these fixes helped a second time.  Noe:  I also used ACE Utilities to do a deep clean of all history.  And *that* is what got my sound back for an hour.<br>
<br>
Have since implemented these changes in about:config<br>
<br>
browser.tabs.remote.autostart.2 = false <br>
security.sandbox.content.level = 1<br>
browser.tabs.remote.autostart = false<br>
<br>
None of the above helps.<br>
<br>
Additional clue:  recently, FF did an upgrade and automatically gave me 32 bit version by some bonehead mistake. I manually fixed that by forcing 64 bit version, but chose to keep it in the same "programs files" folder, rather than "programs (x86)" folder.  Sandboxie forced me into that because the desktop link could not be modified for opening a sandboxed browser.  It would not allow for the programs (x86) folder to be accessed.  Eventually, I was able to hack past that issue and did get the 64 bit FF into the (x86) folder AND the desktop link to link appropriately.  It was soon after that when my sound disappeared in YouTube videos in Sandboxed FireFox windows.<br>
<br>
My thought here is that maybe there's a registry entry that points the sound DLL driver to the "program files" folder, rather than the "programs (x86)" folder?  OR... maybe Sandboxie does this crooked pointing?  After all, it was Sandboxie that fought me in allowing a link to be made to the Firefox program in "program files (x86)" folder.</div>

<strong>Note:</strong> currently my computer runs 64-bit Sandboxie 5.22 and 64-bit Windows 7 Professional SP1 (fully updated to current).   Mozilla updated to Firefox Quantum v. 57 (64-bit)  -- without any warning as to the severity of the changes -- after I responded to a prompt that it was outdated. The only "bug" that I have noticed thus far is that when Firefox launches a video, there is no audio output that accompanies it, regardless of the website to which Firefox is connected.<br>

I got audio to work when Firefox is in Sandboxie by changing the security level to 2 (it was set to 3). Make sure you have taken Firefox out of Sandboxie at first. Then, start Firefox and type in "about:config" (without quotes) into the URL box. Firefox displays a warning. I accepted the consequences. Typed into the search box "security.sandbox.content.level" (without quotes) and that should appear below. Click on modify the value and enter 2. If that doesn't work you can keep reducing that value to 0 security level... not advised.
</div></blockquote>

Lowering the <strong>security.sandbox.content.level </strong>does <em>not</em> work for me, even with the security level reduced to <strong>1</strong>. Maybe I should reduce it to zero just to see whether that will resolve the problem, but I have my doubts.</div>

Stardance, try that. Or, disable Multiprocess (that should do it).<br>

				<div class="content">I have gone through all these changes and only get success occasionally. FF57 works well outside the sandbox but once I run the browser inside the sandbox, i am getting the no sound problem and most videos are either not playing or start very sluggishly. Sometimes I am getting an error relating to shockwave plug in - so it's hard to understand what really is going on. <br>
Clicking Videos on Washington Post doesn't do anything, on NY Times they start with long delays- radiostations may or may not provide sound.<br>
I modified the settings via about:config ( now using security 0 and both autostarts set as false) and even disabled multiprocesses within the gui -<br>
at the moment I am constantly opening chrome just to manage.  I am not willing to give up on Sandboxie but as FF works without I would hope that invincea can come up with a fix for this issue that would allow for FF to be run without having to do all these work-arounds which may or may not have unintended consequences.</div>
