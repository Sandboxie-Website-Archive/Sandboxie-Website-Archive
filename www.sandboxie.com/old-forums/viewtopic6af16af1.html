<br>
I notice when the Immediate Recovery dialog pops up, it appears on top of everything but doesn't assume focus.  Whenever it pops up I make the decision to recover or not so I address the dialog straight away.  Being a shortcut junkie I still sometimes find myself pressing space in a bid to accept, which to me at least, feels like it should be to recover.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if perhaps having it as it is, is to ensure something is not recovered accidentally, but I for one would find it a useful addition if it took focus and recover was the default option.  If not, it' no big deal, just thought I'd mention it.</div>
