I am tired of SB's total failure to delete basic cache info when I delete a sandboxed chrome session!<br>
<br>
*I admit I may not understand how this is suppose to work, but here is what I am doing and what is NOT happening.<br>
<br>
I always have to use multiple steps to hopefully delete Gmail login prompts.  I work hard at trying to remain anonymous with many email addresses used for different tasks ie forums get a series of diff email addr, banking several diff email address, games different email..  etc.  <br>
<br>
My procedure used to be, close the SB browser session and right click the hidden icon for SB control in the lower right on the taskbar, select defaultbox then select delete contents.  Way back that used to appear to delete the current SB browser session, but for several years it has NOT completely erased stuff like Gmail login prompts.  Or it even asks me if I want to restore tabs.  All THIS IS SUPPOSE TO BE CLEARED.  What do I mean by login prompt?   An example is I am using Gmail to email and log out of <a href="mailto:xyz@gmail.com">xyz@gmail.com</a>   I do the above procedure and when I start new sandbox session of Chrome,  and go to Gmail it still wants me to log in as <a href="mailto:xyz@gmail.com">xyz@gmail.com</a>.  That info should have been wiped out with the SB Control delete contents!<br>
<br>
So I switched procedures some time ago,  in sb-chrome clear cache/history, then uses SB Control to delete contents, then go to CCleaner and use it to delete all info in browser sessions (which does nothing for an SB session of Chrome, it wipes out the non SB Chrome cache and history), then 95% of time when I restart an SB chrome session the Gmail login info is gone.  Sometimes I would have to do the procedure again,  do SB-Chrome clear cache/history, then add *do un-SB Chrome clear cache/history, then do CC Cleaner clear all browser info.<br>
<br>
However, all that changed today..  Today I did all that, however, I needed to create a new Gmail email acct.  So I want to see a clean login with None of my other login prompts.  I do the clean procedure as I just described,  I go to Gmail and its a clean login prompt,  I double check history nothing showing, so  I start creating a new Gmail acct and they now added they want to verify with phone #.. I'm not doing that so I exit the email creation and  guess what pops up my Login info from the previous  Gmail login earlier that day.<br>
<br>
What really worries me, is how much info SB leaving behind and is there for any site with bad intentions to freely grab.<br>
I expect when I am using an SB-Chrome session and delete Contents that EVERYTHING IN THAT SESSION IS WIPED CLEAN!   NO previously logged in email session prompts and NO requests to restore tabs.</div>

<br>
If you'd like us to help you test and troubleshoot the problem, please provide the required information:<br>
<a href="viewtopic633b633b.html?f=11&amp;t=19746" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=19746</a><br>
<br>
Regarding Chrome's sessions, their login changed (not too long ago) and it behaves differently now,  I see you posted in the thread as well:<br>
<a href="viewtopice9d6e9d6.html?p=127919#p127919" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?p=127919#p127919</a><br>
<br>
Question remains the same: What is the behavior outside Sandboxie? (if it is the same, then Sandboxie cannot change that either). <br>
You  may want to check out the incognito mode, to see if that satisfies the requirements that you have for your email and private info. <br>
<br>
Perhaps the host is remembering the logins (is it signed in with google)? If so, you will need to clear the host's cache, as Sandboxie will be able to access it.  <br>
Another possibility is that you may be using a template for Chrome that shares browser information with the host. <br>
If you post the required info, plus your Sandboxie configuration file, I'll review it. <br>
Configure--&gt; Edit Configuration <br>
Copy/paste the output<br>
Highlight them and click on the "&lt;/&gt;" button to format it in the forums. <br>
<br>
Keep in mind that some antivirus software may prevent Sandboxie from deleting its contents, thus it is very important that you provide all the information required as per the link I posted at the beginning. <br>
<br>

Sandboxie writes all file changes into the c:\sandbox folder. You can easily see what is in this folder using explorer. After deleting your sandbox, what is being left behind?</div>

This problem has existed for at least 3 years, on multiple PCs with Windows 10,8, It did not exist with I was using FF, which you told me to switch to Chrome, and I reluctantly did.<br>
Currently have 1 desktop PC and 2 laptops all running Windows 10, all clean installed, not upgrade ver.  All harddrives reformated. All start with the following apps installed from latest copy downloads from mother sites.<br>
Windows 10 install<br>
Avast free ver  install<br>
Chrome downloaded from Google <br>
Sandboxie<br>
<br>
I am running the default config for browser only and very rarely run another app inside sandboxie.<br>

I login to use gmail, google calendar, and google Keep.  All require a complete login if I delete sandboxie-chrome, unless its remembering the login info which I am telling you happens nearly every time, unless I go through the lengthy procedure, I have described.<br>
<br>

viewtopic.php?p=127919#p127919<br>
<br>
That no longer works, reason NO gmail-email acct that I have setup, is linked to another.  I do not want google or anyone else to know that acct1 is same person as acct2. Therefore, when I try to use the optout=1 link option I provided in that post: What appears to happen now is It warns me that I am deleting my email acct.  This may be because there are no other email acct linked to my primary or other names.<br>
<br>
barb said; "you may be using a template for Chrome that shares browser information with the host. "<br>
I have no clue how that can happen.  I am using Xfinity cable, I can use a vpn and create new gmail acct (however I always delete SB-chrome the method I descibed which is SB-chrome cache clear, then delete SB contents, then Chrome cache clear, then CCleaner cleaning.  The same problem will happen if I only use SB-Chrome SB-Control "delete contents"   Login info and tabs remembered.<br>
<br>
Ok so if I run sandboxie and run a standalone app installed via sandboxie, to test that app.  I can delete the sandboxie and that app is gone, All traces usually disappear.  I can use "everything" file search which quickly tells me by checking on file names if its all gone, I don't check registery though.   WHY? can't it be the same with a Chrome browser session?  Why are the email login and the question to restore tabs always coming back, they should all be wiped clean.  You say explain what happens outside sandboxie.. NOTHING.. This same situation can occur on reformated harddrive, new install win 10 install of Anti-virus, install of chrome, install of sandboxie. As soon as I log into gmail and log out of gmail, then delete sandboxie-chrome contents..  restart the sandboxie-chrome-browser, chrome will ask to restore tabs.<br>
<br>
What puzzles me is I am not the only one, I have helped others setup and use SB and they have the same issues.  Virus protection is great with SB, but now we have an even more sinister things, data mining and the effort to track who you really are.  We all know they get your IP, thus if you go to google even with cookies cleared and new SB-browser they can identify if same IP, but are they now including in their identifying your PC info so they can easily tell who you are via that PC info + IP, and that is not something SB can deal with?   I used to be able to easily create new gmail accts, using the procedure I normally use now to delete contents of SB-Chrome.  However it seriously scares me that after I did that procedure a couple days ago, Gmail wanted telephone verification for new gmail and instead of me completing the process I exited the process and I am staring at Gmail acct login for one of my gmail accts.  However since I have VPN service I then tried to create new Gmail after my lengthy SB-delete contents process and  I was able to create gmail acct normally without phone verification.<br>

				<div class="content">To find out if your problem is related to Sandboxie you should check the sandbox folder after using "Delete Contents" (like Curt suggested already).<br>
<br>
- If the folder "C:\Sandbox\YourUserName\" is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> empty then something blocks closing Chrome.<br>
- But if the folder is empty then your problem is related to other things like a browser fingerprint.<br>
<br>
You should activate "AutoDelete": Sandboxie Control &gt; Sandbox Settings of DefaultBox &gt; Delete &gt; Invocation &gt; Automatically delete contents of sandbox.</div>

<br>
Adding to what APMichael and Curt suggested...(please test their suggestions first).<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>As soon as I log into gmail and log out of gmail, then delete sandboxie-chrome contents.. restart the sandboxie-chrome-browser, chrome will ask to restore tabs.</div></blockquote>
I cannot repro this, even using 2 gmail accounts, gmail accounts are wiped from Chrome after I delete the Sandboxie contents. <br>
<br>
To be able to get to the bottom of this, let us know the results of the following scenarios/possibilities: <br>
1 - You are logged in on your Host Chrome from before and it is pulling data from there. Please launch your host browser and delete the cache (ctrl+ shift+del) . Ensure to select "All time" so that if there's anything from before, it gets wiped.  Ensure you are not logged in to the browser itself, as that would trigger synch (click on the top right 3 dots --&gt; See if your name is listed under people, if so you will see the Sync options, you can turn them off to test behavior). <br>
2 - Your antivirus software is keeping Sandboxie from deleting contents. Try adding Sandboxie to the AV exclusions and/or uninstall it for testing purposes, then re-try the process.<br>
3 - Your Sandbox may be corrupted, try a new Sandbox with default settings and let us know if the results are the same.  <br>
4 - What happens if you test using incognito mode? Does that change the behavior at all? <br>
5 - Maybe you are using multiple devices to log in to Chrome?<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/185277" class="postlink"> https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/185277</a><br>

PS: 
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>We all know they get your IP, thus if you go to google even with cookies cleared and new SB-browser they can identify if same IP, but are they now including in their identifying your PC info so they can easily tell who you are via that PC info + IP, and that is not something SB can deal with?

Have a look at this <a href="../PrivacyConcerns.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/PrivacyConcerns</a> <br>
IP Privacy<br>
Sandboxie isolation and protection occurs entirely within the local computer and is not visible to any other remote computer. Thus accessing the Internet using a sandboxed program looks the same as accessing the Internet using a program that is not running under Sandboxie. In both cases the remote computer identifies the accessing computer by its IP address. ...</div>
