				<div class="content">Hi there,<br>
<br>
for a while im using Clean Slate and Deepfreeze Enterprise.<br>
i tested both and both failed my tests<br>
<br>
i was able to mess my windows up with security fully enabled..<br>
<br>
how? using a hex editor to write data to the disk.<br>
<br>
now i know sandboxie can protect against this, but i need a full recovery after reboot, while users have full access.<br>
<br>
Does anybody know more software like this that is more bulletproof?<br>
<br>
tnx a lot</div>

That truly worrying...   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"></div>

<br>
-overwriting the bootsector messed up the system.<br>
-overwriting deepfreeze driver/program files messed up the system.<br>

so i wasn't too happy with that!</div>

Frankly, I'm not that surprised, and I'm not sure it's even possible to protect a system from whithin if you one can mess up at kernel level (and Deep Freeze does allow to install drivers). Still, it's ridiculous that it can be bypassed so easily by simple raw editing the disk...  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> What version of Deep Freeze is this, version 6?</div>

				<div class="content">Well there arent really that many freezing programs out there and it has been a while since i used any of them and i have forgot most of them, but ill list what i remember:<br>
<br>
1. DeepFreeze<br>
2. CleanSlate<br>
3. Shadowuser<br>
4. i cant remeber the name of this particular software, but it starts with a "R"  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"><br>
<br>
Also, as an alternative to freezing your pc, you could use a software like Rollback RX and just make a backup of your whole pc, then proceed to let you, your kids, your spouse, your buddies etc. do whatever they/you want on your pc, and when you want, just roll right back to your latest backup, so in a way it is like Windows System Restore, BUT, it is much more stable, faster, secure, smaller, lighter, and it makes a backup of everything compared to System Restore which only backsup system files and apparently on a 60gb hd, you can store up to 60,000 backups <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"></div>
