				<div class="content">I am using Sandboxie 5.22 in Windows 10 x64 and I installed Firefox 57. I set the sandbox level to 2 and disabled multi process by setting browser.tabs.remote.autostart to false and browser.tabs.remote.autostart.2 to false.<br>
<br>
One thing I have not been able to solve is the Firefox icon pinned to the taskbar, when I click it to start Firefox it creates another icon. I have Firefox forced to a sandbox but I went ahead and modified the icon shortcut to use the sandboxie start, but that didn't help it still starts in a separate icon so I end up having a double icon one next to the other (the pinned icon and next to it the actual running firefox icon).</div>

Thanks Bo but that's actually what I did ( I deleted the old icon and pinned the new icon when I updated to 57) and it didn't work, i get a second icon, which is why I modified the shortcut but that didn't work either. Are you able to reproduce this in Windows 10? I should mention I'm using the 64-bit version of Firefox, not 32-bit.</div>

I cannot repro the issue using Win 10 x64 FCU + Sbie 5.23.1 beta.<br>
Does the pinned icon work outside Sandboxie?  (Sbie Control --&gt;File --&gt; Disable Forced Programs  then, launch Firefox from the pinned icon). <br>

Yes, the pinned icon works outside Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
To test this further I updated to SandboxieInstall64-523-1.exe and Firefox Setup 57.0.2.exe (64-bit), and then I created a new Windows user and a new Sandbox "Test". On that account the pinned icon is used normally (without Sandboxie) but when Firefox is run in the Sandbox then the pinned icon is not used. I don't know why I can reproduce only on this Windows 10 computer but not in a Windows 10 VM.<br>

I am not experiencing any issues with the pinned Firefox icon and Windows 10 x64 FCU (no VM). <br>
<br>
Do you have a screenshot of what you are seeing? <br>
Do other sandboxed programs behave in the same way?<br>
How are you pinning the icon?<br>
<br>
Please right-click on the pinned icon (menu appears)<br>
Right-click on Mozilla Firefox ---&gt; Properties<br>
What's the "Target" showing? <br>

The problem is only with Firefox as far as I know. Chrome works fine and I only run browsers in the sandbox on this computer.<br>
<br>
I pinned the icon by clicking on the desktop shortcut and clicking pin to taskbar. I've done it dozens of times now in order to investigate this. I also checked the User Pinned folder to make sure there aren't duplicate icons.<br>
<br>
Here is an animated gif showing the double icon.

				<div class="content">Thanks. I have already tried the solutions in that article. Specifically I have re-created the taskbar icon numerous times and also cleared out the user pinned directory. Also as I mentioned this happens on a new user account that I created just to test this issue. So it is some combination of Firefox and Sandboxie and my Windows 10, but I don't know what.</div>

				<div class="content">I had that behavior on one Windows 7 system some time ago.<br>
<br>
I could solve it:<br>
- Remove the pinned Firefox icon.<br>
- Start a <span style="text-decoration: underline">sandboxed</span> Firefox.<br>
- Right click the Firefox icon on the taskbar.<br>
- And select "pin to taskbar".<br>
<br>
Maybe this works for you also.<br>
<br>
<br>
(BTW: You can force/repro that behavior if you previously taskkill and restart "explorer.exe" as admin. After that a duplicated icon appears always - until a clean reboot.)</div>

Thanks but this doesn't work. The running Firefox icon in the taskbar only has an exit entry in the right click menu, so there is nowhere to select pin. You can see it in the animated GIF in the post I made Dec 12.</div>
