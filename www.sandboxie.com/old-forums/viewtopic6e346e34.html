				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
I have been using the Epic browser sandboxed, and Sandboxie automatically empties the sandbox when closing the brower, but bookmarks are gone the next time, unless I make them unsandboxed. <br>
<br>
How can I set it up so Sandboxie allows bookmarks to stay in Epic? (Epic is not on the browsers list of Sandboxie, otherwise I would have solved this already.)</div>

				<div class="content">PS:<br>
I see a typo in my above post -brower instead of browser- but no option to correct it. If I remember well in the past there always was a premanent edit option. I think it would be good to have that option. But maybe I'm mistaken about that option always being there even a long time after posting.<br>
In any case it would be good to offer it to us.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

				<div class="content">Hello Lode,<br>
<br>
I tested on Windows 10, and the location for the bookmarks is:<br>
%LocalAppdata%\Epic Privacy Browser\User Data\Default\Bookmarks<br>
<br>
So you need to right-click on your Sandbox ---&gt; Sandbox Settings<br>
Direct Access<br>
Edit/Add<br>
And paste the path I provided.<br>
<br>
If you are using a custom path, or a different OS,  you will have to adjust it to match whichever location contains that file. <br>
Most of the settings for Epic Browser are located in that folder : %LocalAppdata%\Epic Privacy Browser\ ...<br>
So if you need to add direct access for other things, you may follow the same steps provided above. <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-<br>

				<div class="content">Thank you very much, Barb.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
I added a new bookmark while sandboxed, closed the browser, opened it again, and the bookmark was there. Then -still sandboxed- I removed it, closed the browser, opened it again, and the bookmark was gone.<br>
Very glad this is solved.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>
