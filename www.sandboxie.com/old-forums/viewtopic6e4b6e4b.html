It lasts for a couple of seconds and then works fine again. Could that be Flash? Note: I'm still using Sandboxie 4.12 on the computer.

				<div class="content">Hi Bellzemos, I have no issue running Firefox 33 under Sandboxie 4.14 in XP or W7. Since you are having problems with webpages that contain flash content, as a workaround, try disabling Flash Protected mode to see if it makes a difference for you.<br>

Over the last two pages in this thread, when you read Curt's comments regarding Drop Rights and Chrome, its  clear that they are working on the issue. As you know, the issue doesn't affect every system. Its gotta be difficult to fix something that they cant reproduce, you know. <br>
<br>
I am not a Chrome user but ever since Chrome 37 came out, I installed Chrome 3 times, twice in my W7 and once in XP and Chrome ran great in my computers. At no time I got an strange message or had the browser crashing. And I was able to tick Drop Rights with no consequence. The only message that I got is the bits message which I hid. <br>
<br>
Perhaps one of your security programs is messing up your Chrome sandbox. I know I told you about Bit defender before and later you found BD messing your SBIE a little bit (the screen shot you posted). Its possible that BD its also causing your issue regarding Drop Rights. Check it out, you got nothing to lose. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>

				<div class="content">Yep, fixing unreproducible may be hard. Teamviewer may be helpful.<br>
As you can see on screenshoots (posted few times already since 4.13.3 beta) fonts were broken even with direct access to font cache/IPCsomething if dropped rights box was ticked.<br>
Yep, Bitdefender is pretty unpredictable, can mess with other process without notification. I'll add it to AppGuard exceptions. However I completely uninstalled Bitdefender for 2 weeks and chrome was crashing same way.<br>

				<div class="content">We have never been able to reproduce the Chrome crash with dropped rights at Invincea.  I believe there are about 6 people that have reported this problem in the forum.<br>
<br>
There is something on your machine that is causing this problem.  Have you tried a clean install of Chrome -- with no add-ons (extensions) and default settings only?  Have you tried to disable all AV and anti-malware software?</div>

				<div class="content">Dun, regarding the antivirus and other security programs that you are using, for testing to see if one of them is causing your issue, its probably better if you uninstall them instead of disabling.<br>

				<div class="content">Curt@: ~6 people, yes, so it's not just me. Things you mentioned were first thing I've tried lately and few sandboxie versions back.<br>
Does any of your testing machines use non-english os/chrome locale?<br>
<br>
I deleted all extensions and bring back default chrome configuration. After that disabled Bitdefender service in safe mode to prevent startup and renamed the main Bitdefender folder. Then disabled some third party services and started Windows in 'Diagnostic startup mode' to be sure nothing than basic windows services are running. Of course needed to start sandboxie service manually when rebooted. Nothing changed.<br>
<br>

<br>
Font is broken like always when dropped rights are enabled. 3x chrome and 6x sandboxie processes. Chrome works fine if dropped rights option is unticked. the only one idea I have is to change Windows locale back to english but this shouldn't really matter</div>

				<div class="content">Chrome uses Segoe UI in settings tab etc. With dropped rights it tries to use it but for some reason  it can't so uses Times New Roman instead. If you copy the text and paste to Word then in both cases it's gonna be Segoe UI. If you look at screenshoot above with dropped rights you know it's Times New Roman. So looks like it can't render any other fonts</div>
