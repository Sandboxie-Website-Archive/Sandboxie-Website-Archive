<br>
Just a quick note for Kaspersky Users.<br>
<br>
You can uninstall 2015 and 2016 and revert to Pure 3 and sandboxie works good with it.<br>
Seem Kaspersky is still working on the bug and they have no update yet I am told.<br>

Hope this helps other Kaspersky users.<br>

That seems to mirror what I saw as well. KS, no matter the version, won't work in 10 with SBIE.<br>
<br>
However, there has been some success with KS in 7, 8.1 using 2015. 2016 seems to break that.</div>

Hoepfully it's a bug, but from what the Devs have seen and how KS interacts with windows, it's very very intrusive and thus it directly conflicts with SBIE. Unless they make some major changes, It won't work with SBIE (at least in Win 10 and KS 2015/16).</div>

I've been running ESET Smart Security 8 (and now 9) since Sandboxie 5 beta (now at 5.06) in my Windows 10 Pro x64 with no problems at all. Seems like ESET plays great with Sandboxie, and also AdGuard (which has some issues with AVs scanning HTTPs traffic).<br>
<br>
Count my vote to ESET as one of the best AVs available.</div>

				<div class="content">I can not get SBIE 5.06 to work with Norton Internet Security 22.5.4.24 and Firefox 41.0.2 no matter what I do. I thought I had a temp work around by turning NIS off under the advance settings for their firewall and intrusion protection and then starting SBIE, after FF came up in SBIE, I went back to NIS and turned it all their security back on. This worked a few times and thought I could live with it, but now that doesn't work either. I tried a reload overwrite on SBIE to see if the workaround would start working again but didn't make any diff. Is there any way to get these SW's to play nice with each other?? Norton forum does not respond or seem to care at all. <br>

Basically Norton is playing up for some configurations with Firefox, and I uninstalled my Norton 360 22.5.4.24 on my Win 8.1 machine, and I now just use Defender and sandboxie because I need firefox.</div>

What will this mean to me as a long term KIS user; and have you tested 2016 which I believe is a beta but is available now?<br>
<br>
This is one of the main and best a-v programs. You HAVE to get Sandboxe working with it somehow IMO.</div></blockquote>
I agreed +1.<br>

Dear Craig@Invincea, hope you can consider it. Look forward update from your end.</div>
