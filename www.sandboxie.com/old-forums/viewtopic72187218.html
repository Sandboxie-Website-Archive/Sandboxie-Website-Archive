				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
i'm using sandboxie and i have a sandbox with restricted admin rights<br>
now when i'm trying to install any programm, it requires admin rights (SBIE2217, SBIE2219, SBIE2220)<br>
<br>
actually, i don't get what that means and what it does<br>
<br>
my user account on windows 8 x64 runs with UAC disabled<br>
so the sandboxie should have admin rights itself<br>
but what if i grant admin rights for a programm in a sandbox?<br>
i don't understand what that menas<br>
does it mean the programm will break out the box and will have any effect on my computer?<br>
<br>
please enlighten me<br>
thanks in advance</div>

To install a program in a sandbox you need to disable Drop Rights.<br>
<br>
Programs are not going to break out of the sandbox when you disable Drop Rights.<br>

You've disabled UAC yet you don't know what administrator privileges make possible? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control#Tasks_that_trigger_a_UAC_prompt" class="postlink">Hmm...</a><br>

<br>
<strong>The setting in this page causes Sandboxie to strip administrative rights from programs running in this sandbox.</strong><br>
<br>
Specifically, the security credentials used to start the sandboxed program will not include membership in the Administrators and Power Users groups.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note that this has little effect if you are already running under a non-Administrator user account.</strong></div></blockquote>

<br>
On one level it's an extra bit of restriction on software running in a sandbox, not allowing installations or system file updates for example, even though such changes would take place in the sandbox you may not want software or users to have that ability. <br>
<br>
Notice the settings box says it's similar to the <strong>DropMyRights</strong> utility, you can read about that <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13554_3-9756656-33.html" class="postlink">HERE</a>.</div>

				<div class="content">TheGreenHorn, I like this thread about Drop Rights, is a little old but is good read. I go along the thoughts exposed in posts #2, #3 and #4 in page 2. Put special attention to Tzuks post, also on page 2.<br>
