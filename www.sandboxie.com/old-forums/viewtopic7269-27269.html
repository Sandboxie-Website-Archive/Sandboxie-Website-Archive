				<div class="content">I haven't had a chance to study the product well but I wish to express my gratitude for your work in sandbox dev and for offering it to us to evaluate. The sandboxing concept is one I wish more would work at. So many think that process filters/firewalls such as AbtusionProtector and SystemSafetyMonitor are sandboxes. While they are great tools, they don't allow to run a process in the box. Thank you.  I look fwd to seeing what &amp; where you go from here with future dev.</div>

I just thought it would be nice if there was a little background info given on the author of this software. Perhaps something about how and why you got interested in this project. What other involvement you may have had in the pri/sec community. etc.<br>
Just curious and I think a little more info may help people feel better about giving this program a chance. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>

Agreed 100%.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">  I think this is a great effort by tzuk and very impressive that it is *freeware*! Excellent!!!   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>

				<div class="content">Whoa, thanks guys!  It is really heart-warming to read your words.  I'm happy to see that you think Sandboxie may be useful, and if you have any ideas about making it even more useful, please don't hesitate to share!<br>
<br>
(In the works is a Sandboxie Toolbar for IE, which I hope would be far more intuitive than that weird yellow guy sitting in the system tray area.    <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> )<br>
<br>
I began to work on Sandboxie after I got my system 'infected' with a homepage hijacker that none of the popular spyware removal tools could detect.  Eventually I messed my registry just enough to get rid of that hijacker, but by that time I was already making good progress with the development of Sandboxie.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>

				<div class="content">I hope the 'toolbar' will be optional and not the only UI. I'm not to partial to browser 'add-ons' especially if a BHO is required. Too many BHOs makes for unhappy conflict. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
"...I got my system 'infected'..."<br>
<br>
Thx for the response and candor. As I was saying at <a href="http://spywarewarrior.com/viewtopic.php?t=4589" class="postlink">http://spywarewarrior.com/viewtopic.php?t=4589</a> , I think this tool could possibly serve other purposes as well. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
BTW Your bandwidth could surge in the next few days as I believe the product may be discussed on some of the larger tech boards too. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

				<div class="content">I've only had a brief opportunity to review the product myself. But I can already see this is one I will be recommending folks take a look at. <br>
<br>
It was mentioned to me early this morning, again on mailing list today and then by pm from a member of my board a little bit ago.  So its clear you are beginning to attract a little attention. This is good.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing this app develop. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

				<div class="content">Wow, this is a very nice concept. Great for testing out malware, but I'm not so sure the masses can be convinced to run this. It's a great protection layer though.<br>
<br>
A question: is it possible, at one point when having IE sandboxed, to see what changes to the sandboxed system have been made? I.e. files created, registry changes, etc. This would make it an even greater tool.</div>

				<div class="content">I am about to try your program and hit your forum before getting the chance to use it <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">  But from  the sounds of what it does I wanted to say thnx and what a great concept!!! I will return with the outcome of my use and let you know how it helped. <br>
I am constantly disecting the crap I pick up from browsing the internet so that i can identify and return the attacks that alot of these malware companies impose on my computer,, so this should help alot to quickly locate the files and changes that were made and get busy to track back and give them back some of there own medicine <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"> <br>
<br>
Thnx again and I will update you on results</div>
