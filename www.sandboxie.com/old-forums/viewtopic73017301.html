				<div class="content">Hi guys,<br>
<br>
Win Pro x64 on latest beta (4.01.03)  Force Folders functionality is not working for me. Similarly Force Process has no effect if the process is launched from inside a Forced Folder. Nothing in the RAM, absolutely empty.   All my forced folders are on partitions other than the system one (C:\ for me)  <br>
<br>
I had this on beta .01 but a clean install rather than over the top fixed it, not this time unfortunately.<br>
<br>
No other security products installed.<br>
<br>
Not expecting any response just reporting an issue which hopefully can be fixed going forward. Let me know if you need anything from me to clarify/assist. <br>
<br>
Cheers</div>

I am having a similar issue. I've forced my desktop into Force Folder but .exe files started from desktop won't automatically start sandboxed. Using Windows 8 x64 with 4.01.03. I had no issues with 3.74 Win 7 x64.</div>

				<div class="content">A minor bug, which affected only the 64-bit version, prevented the forced folders feature working correctly on Windows 8.<br>
Should be fixed in version 4.01.04.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks tzuk! It's working great again! Man, do I love your software!<br>
<br>
Hopefully 4.x will be as safe as 3.7x ever was when it's finally released!</div>
