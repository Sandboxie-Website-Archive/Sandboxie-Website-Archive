				<div class="content">I would like to see the max size of the file migration increased to at least 250 gb if not 500 gb the reason is because of the ever increasing cloud based storage particularly the browser based ones and giving the fact that the average hard drive size is around 250 now its about time that Sandboxie upgrades its limits which it has in other ways but this is the next step in its evolution in my eyes more and more users are taking advantage of cloud based storage I cant state this enough an example of one resent cloud based service is Amazon they have both a free service and paid the later has much more space available obviously so its just a mater of time before Sandboxie users rum into problems with the old size limit so please look into this when you have the time Ronen Tzur its quite important atleast down the road.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't think anyone has 250GB files.<br>
<br>
Isn't the size limit for individual files? I believe it is.</div>

				<div class="content">This doesn't make any sense from a usability standpoint. Do you know how long it would take to copy a 250GB file into the sandbox so you can work with it?  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>
So even if you could, it would take aeons for the operation to complete.<br>
What kind of files are we talking about anyway?   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"></div>
