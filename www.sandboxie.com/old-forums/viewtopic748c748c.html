				<div class="content">Hi. I wanted to download the latest sandboxie (5.20) manually from the older versions page, but when I tried I got sbie 1308 "Program can't start due to restriction" and it mentioned dllhost.exe, which is obviously not allowed to run in the download folder. Why would a sandboxie download activate dllhost.exe? I am suspicious that some covert program was trying to sneak into the folder and activate. I scanned all the relevant folders for viruses but found nothing. Is there an innocent explanation?<br>
<br>
BTW it did allow me to download 5.20 afterwards, but I have yet to allow it until this is cleared up.<br>
<br>
Thanks for opinions.</div>

				<div class="content">You cam allow dllhost.exe to run in your browser Sandbox settings. Or, you can close the message and continue with the downloading process, it ll go trough even if you dont allow dllhost.exe to run. <br>
<br>
It is normal for dllhost.exe to attempt to run when you browse using File explorer to find the folder where you want a download to be downloaded to. You ll also see dllhost.exe attempting to run like for example, if you want to upload a picture to an image hosting site and you use File explorer while browsing sandboxed for navigating to the picture you want to upload. Another example were dllhost.exe attempts to run would be when uploading a file to a site like Virus total, so, anytime you use File explorer while browsing sandboxed, you might see dllhost.exe try to run.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, if you allow dllhost.exe to run, only dllhost.exe thats in your system would be able to run. If malware using the name dllhost.exe gets dowloaded into rthe sandbox, it wouldnt be allowed to run. So, is safe to allow dllhost.exe to run in Sandbox settings.<br>

				<div class="content">Thanks for replying bo.elam! What confuses me is when you said:<br>
<br>
"It is normal for dllhost.exe to attempt to run when you browse using File explorer to find the folder where you want a download to be downloaded to."<br>
<br>
I didn't browse, dllhost.exe just popped up of its own accord when I attempted the download. Is that normal?<br>
<br>
Thanks again!</div>

dllhost.exe tries to run when File explorer pops up open as you attempt to download, like in the picture I posted. Thats normal.<br>

				<div class="content">Yes, it is normal dllhost.exe wanting to run. I'd allow it to run indefinitely cause it will start popping up annoying constant messages.</div>
