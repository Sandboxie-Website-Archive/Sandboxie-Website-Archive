				<h3>After update to FF58 no audio in sandboxed browser [SOLVED]</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Wed Jan 24, 2018 3:31 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I just updated my <span class="posthilit">Firefox</span> to the new version 58.0 (in my unsandboxed <span class="posthilit">firefox</span>). That's all I do with <span class="posthilit">Firefox</span> outside the Sandbox in general. After the installation went through I quickly realised that Youtube videos, Twitch content, pretty much any media with audio doesnt play <span class="posthilit">sound</span> in my sandboxed browser anymore. In addition to that on Twitch all I see is the player practically showing a slideshow. No lowering of the resolution works in that case. YT videos run fine but also no audio.<br>
<br>
I was quick to blame <span class="posthilit">Firefox</span> itself because that's the only thing that has changed. But then I checked a YT video in the unsandboxed FF58 and you guessed it I had <span class="posthilit">sound</span>. Clearing the DefaultBox (I had Sandboxie create the sandboxed browser box for me when I first started using Sandboxie) and then restarting the sb.ed FF yielded the same issue. FF58 introduced volume controls to each tab - I made sure that is not the problem at hand here (muted the tab and umuted it). Also FF is unmuted in the Windows Mixer and its volume slider is at 85%. The soundcard/loudspeakers work in general: videos in vlc work fine, so does music in winamp.<br>
<br>
Im using WIndows 7, 64-bit. Sandboxie version is 5.22, 64-bit (auto-update enabled). FF is as stated above version 58.0, 64-bit.<br>
<br>
My <strong>guess </strong>is since FF58 is messing with volume controls and so forth that it now somehow requires access to resources that my Defaultbox currently cannot reach? What do you guys think does FF58 break Sandboxie audio?</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Geordy,, if Barbs suggestion doesnt fix your <span class="posthilit">sound</span> issue, try toggling both preferences below in about:config to false:<br>
<br>
browser.tabs.remote.autostart<br>
browser.tabs.remote.autostart.2<br>
<br>
I read someone in another forum who used to fix his <span class="posthilit">sound</span> issue by switching security.sandbox.content.level to 2 (Barbs suggestion), that now for <span class="posthilit">Firefox</span> 58, he has to disable Multiprocess (the alternate fix I suggested you try).<br>
<br>
....................<br>
<br>
FWIW. I dont have the <span class="posthilit">sound</span> issue but I disable Multiprocess. I have been doing it from day 1. In my W10, the update to version 58, reenabled Multiprocess automatically. I had to disable it afterward again. So, anyone who has been disabling MP as a workaround, should check to make sure it is still disabled after updating <span class="posthilit">Firefox</span>.<br>

				<div class="content">Thank you for providing the link, Barb! I've got to admit I feel a little dumb now seeing that there was a thread already discussing my problem.<br>
<br>
The <span class="posthilit">sound</span> is back now. Here is what I have done: <br>
I went into the sandbox security levels and the browser.tab.remote settings and tried every combination. In the end the security levels were fine on default. What did the trick is a manual override to the <strong>browser.tabs.remote.autostart</strong> entry. Note there is no '2' in the title. The autostart2 entry is on false by default with the current SB version. <br>
<br>
I believe what the update to FF58 did was resetting the <strong>browser.tabs.remote.autostart</strong> entry back to 'true" by default. Toggling that back to false gave me the <span class="posthilit">sound</span>.<br>
<br>
So in summary:<br>
browser.tabs.remote.autostart / <strong>modified </strong>/ <strong>false</strong> (&lt;~~ needed manual correction)<br>
browser.tabs.remote.autostart.2 / <strong>modified </strong>/ <strong>false</strong> (&lt;~~was like that from the start)<br>
security.sandbox.content.level / default / 4 (&lt;~~was like that from the start, new FF default, didnt matter at all in the end)<br>
<br>
The security levels are now at 4 by default but at least the YT videos dont seem to mind. Thanks again for your prompt assistance!<br>
<br>
<em>Edit:</em> Yes that was exactly it. Thank you, too, elam!</div>
