				<div class="content">I finally got fed up with Microsoft's stream of security updates for Windows 7, so I upgraded to Windows 10 only to find it was worse, so I decided I wanted an alternative on-line security solution.<br>
<br>
After some research, the solution I settled on was a clean install of Windows 7 SP1 (with all updates disabled), a 3rd party Antivirus and then, for belt and braces, Sandboxie to run all my internet access programs (Browser and Email).<br>
<br>
It works a dream. I'd forgotten how fast and slick a clean install of Windows 7 SP1 is (cold boots in 15 secs), the User interface is also so much better (more consistent) than Windows 10. Sandboxie was easy to install and setup. I believe that Sandboxie, in combination with a good AV, will give me a sensible level of protection against online threats without relying on a never-ending stream of Microsoft bug fixes and security updates which bloat my PC and slow it down. It's so nice to be able shut down/reboot the PC and know that it isn't going to install MS Updates that sometimes produce more problems than they fix. I'm looking forward to a more stable computing environment.<br>
<br>
I was also very impressed with the expert support provided via the forum which very quickly resolved the questions I had.<br>
<br>
EXCELLENT!</div>
