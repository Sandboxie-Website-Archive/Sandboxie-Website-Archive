No idea which sandboxie-setting is wrong. It just doesn't work. Also Sanboxie Beta. BS: Windows 10 per x64. Outside the sandbox <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked">  there are no problems.</div>

If you think you cant watch the video due to a sandbox setting, then you should try doing it in a new sandbox with default settings. You can create a new one and dont copy settings from existing sandboxes.<br>
<br>
If you are using an script blocker or ad blocker, make sure to allow whats required. I tested the site using Firefox in W7 32 bits and the video played fine.<br>

<br>
I tested Opera 41 + SBIE 5.14 on a Win 10 - 64 machine and I was able to play the video (<a href="http://video.golem.de/pc-hardware/17866/apple-macbook-pro-2016-live-demo.html" class="postlink">http://video.golem.de/pc-hardware/17866 ... -demo.html</a> ).<br>
<br>
Can you try updating Opera and let us know if that works? <br>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I have the same problem with opera 41 running in sandboxie 5.14 on windows 10 64bit.<br>
If I run opera without sandboxie I am able to play this video. <br>
Therefore it seems this is a sandboxie and not opera problem.<br>
With sandboxie I am not able to run imdb videos as well. (f.e. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2788732/" class="postlink">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2788732/</a>) . Disabling ad-blockers does not help (opera built-in and AdBlock).<br>
I observe this problem with sandboxie and opera only since I upgraded from windows 7 to windows 10.<br>
<br>

I am still trying to reproduce this issue, however SBIE 5.14 + Opera + Win 10 x 64 is allowing me to play those videos just fine. I have a few questions for you... <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
Do you have Opera Turbo enabled?  Activating this caused problems for me, but if I deactivate it, everything seems to be running fine.<br>
Are you using any toolbars/AV software? Do you have any extensions installed in Opera? <br>
Is this issue happening in a new Sandbox ?<br>
<br>
Thanks.</div>

Hi,<br>
<br>
Opera turbo in main menu is disabled. I don't have any tool-bars. I have AV software Eset SmartSecurity 10.0.369.0. <br>
I have few extensions installed but even if I disable them all this problem occurs as well.<br>
Running opera in new sandbox causes this issue as well. <br>
Maybe it will help but I don't have any flash installed. (so it occurs only with html5 videos).<br>
Interestingly, I don't have issue with most of youtube videos but with imdb or amazon.de promotional videos it is 100% reproducible.</div>

				<div class="content">The same here. Also a new sandbox does not help. Also not in standard settings .. Without sandboxie, everything works. Windows 10, Flash is installed. Extensions disabled. Anyway Opera 34+ is badly supported in sandboxie. <br>
<br>
It's time to remove Opera 12.x, or customize sandboxie with a new templates.ini.<br>
<br>
Can not load video<br>

<br>
In newest version of Sandboxie some video streams cannot be played in opera 45 (although they could be played with older version of sandboxie 5.17).<br>
It seems that the same problem which was fixed already in 5.17 and reported here <a href="viewtopic97ea97ea.html?f=11&amp;t=23576" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 11&amp;t=23576</a> reappeared.<br>
Error message: 'Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.'<br>
If I run opera outside of sandboxie, video is playable.<br>

<br>
I merged your post since it is the same issue and this thread was never marked resolved.<br>
<br>
I am confirming the problem happens on both Opera 32 and 64 bits using the latest versions of it. <br>
<br>
I'll make the devs aware.<br>

				<div class="content">As with previous post about Opera 45, since Opera updated itself to version 45, html5 videos do not play inside the sandbox. They do play when Opera is not sandboxed. The flash player videos do play in the sandboxed Opera. I have windows 7-64 bit premium and the 5.18 Sandboxie version. <br>
<br>
Please, can you try and fix this problem? Using Opera is one of the most straight-forward ways to deal with the Sandboxie-Kaspersky compatibility issues. They do “play” well together when you use Opera as your browser!</div>

				<div class="content">I still suffer from this issue now with Opera 46.0.2597.39 . Videos work just fine outside of Sandboxie. I don't have turbo or any plug-ins activated that could interfere, neither do I work with anti-virus. Problem seems to be the just the browser. <br>
Would be great if you could fix that. I've been using Opera and Sandboxie for years now and  I am a big fan of the product. <br>
Not being able to play videos on so many pages is really a hassle though.</div>
