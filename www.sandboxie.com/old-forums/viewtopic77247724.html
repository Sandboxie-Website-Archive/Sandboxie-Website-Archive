				<div class="content">It's not likely, in my view.<br>
If Firefox is closed normally it will save the open tab information as it ends, but that's probably not what will happen if it crashes or if you have to force end the program, such as using Terminate Program(s).<br>
It doesn't hurt to try it, though.<br>
<br>
From a previous post of mine:<br>
Just be sure that your Firefox Options say "Show my windows and tabs from last time", and (not so obviously) don't allow Privacy tab &gt; "Clear history when Firefox closes" &gt; Settings, to delete the "Browsing History".<br>
<br>
I haven't tried saving open tab information lately, but previous versions of Firefox would only save the information if the most recent browsing history is available.</div>

Well Ive had success recover my open tabs when I've had Thunderbird open and I had to force close Firefox then I reopened FF and all my tabs were there so with that information do you think I'll be able to do the same without having Thunderbird or another browser open if I save  session management outside the sandbox?</div>

Well I just configured Sandboxie to save session management data outside side the sandbox so I did a test and first I opened Firefox and 5 tabs then closed FF and deleted contents next I opened FF again and then went to history&gt; restore previous session and it opened all of the 5 tabs I had previously opened so yes it does allow you to pickup were you last left off so if anybody is having trouble with Firefox crashing or freezing/stalling then they might want to save session data outside of Sandboxie. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":idea:" title="Idea">  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>

Did you try using terminate program, which might simulate a crash?</div>
