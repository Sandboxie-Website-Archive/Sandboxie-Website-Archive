				<h3>Config for router-USB networked printer? [SOLVED]</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Mon Jan 29, 2018 6:43 pm</strong></div>

<br>
In the past I used a Bluetooth dongle on my laptop to print to a Canon MX850. SBIE would throw up a popup I could click on to allow a print job to pass to the printer.<br>
<br>
Recently I got a new router with USB port so now the printer is plugged into the router so I can print wirelessly w/o the dongle.<br>
<br>
The printer works flawlessly except in SBIE. I don't get a popup or any error. The printer's window just pops up saying it's offline (but it's really online).<br>
<br>
If I reopen the browser unboxed, it prints fine.<br>
<br>
Do I need to add a path to the printer via the SBIE Edit Config? If so (sorry to be dense) how do I know what the path to the printer is? TIA</div>

				<div class="content">No one? Is anyone out there using a printer connected to the USB port of their router?  It's a common configuration these days and I'm sure SBIE can do it with a little tweak... ?</div>

				<div class="content">Hello 000,<br>
<br>
Can you print from any other Sandboxed programs? (Notepad, Office apps, other browsers...) <br>
Does the issue occur in a new Sandbox with default settings? <br>
Is there any antivirus software involved? <br>
<br>
Please provide the results of running Resource Access Monitor in a new Sandbox with default settings , while trying to print:<br>
<a href="../ResourceAccessMonitor.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/ResourceAccessMonitor</a><br>
After copy/pasting the output in your response, highlight it and click on the "&lt;/&gt;" button to format it. <br>
<br>
Also, give this setting a try:<br>
Right click on your Sandbox---&gt; Sandbox settings ---&gt; Restrictions ---&gt; Network Files <br>
Un-check "block network files and folders unless specifically open" <br>
Hit Apply, OK<br>
Configure --&gt; Reload Configuration<br>
Test printing again.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-<br>
<br>
PS: Moving this to problem reports for now.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks so much for your reply, Barb. I tried printing in notepad sandboxed and it worked. Then tried Firefox in SBIE and THAT worked... finally went to my default browser that wouldn't print before, which is the newest Waterfox... and this time for some reason, it printed! Must have been a glitch before. I was trying to print a return label off the Amazon site, which would not print inside SBIE, but printed fine from Waterfox unboxed (that day). So tried going into WF again, with SBIE and again it would not print. (This was all the other day.)<br>
<br>
But now it's fine. Maybe it's printing from Amazon that's the issue as the return label pops up in a separate window... don't know why that would affect it, but maybe it did... IAC it works now! YAY!<br>
<br>
And thank you for providing an updated SBIE for the new OS patches for Spectre/Meltdown!</div>
