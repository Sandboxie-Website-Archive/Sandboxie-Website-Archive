The topic has ever been posted in "Problem Report". But for a few days, there have no any reply, even a post with just "ok" or "no". So I had to think that maybe I posted in wrong place. It was posted here again. <br>
<br>
I don't like to wait. Please let me know "yes" or "no". If it is "no", no problem with it. But please don't let user wait so many days.</div>

It's a suggestion, not just like every post. Why do users post their suggestions? Because they love SBie and desire that it can be improved, even if some of suggestions are not accepted, my friend.<br>
<br>
You're the author of SBie, not like a normal user of SBie. Everyone who post his suggestion is expecting to get your reply on it, to know what your opinion is, especially there is no other ones' replies. They just wanna improve SBie, not for other purposes. They are not willing to let you must accept every suggestion, but they need your opinion, Yes, No or as "I'll think it over". Just a very simple reply, not more.</div>

Instead of taking offense or duplicating your post on the forum just because you didn't get any responses, it would be better to just clarify your post, or to not even post it at all if it has already been posted before in the past (which you can check using a forum search).<br>
Otherwise, you just have to wait for someone to respond, if they choose to. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>

<br>
It is because of the problem on internet, not replying on my own topic intentionally . I have researched, there is no such suggestion before posting mine. And if my topic is hard to understand. I hope Tzuk can let me know as what he do in other topics.<br>
<br>
It is weird that there is no any response. I don't need anyone must accept my suggestion. I just wanna know whether my suggestion is workable, which is everyone who post their suggestions here want. It's not excessive totally.<br>
<br>
I am also weird that Tzuk always are very positive to fans' feedback, including my last topics or replies. Why not this one?  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"></div>

				<div class="content">OK, I see I have to explain every little thing I do, or this discussion will go on.<br>
<br>
The point of the non-expanding empty folder has actually crossed my mind while working on this aspect of Sandboxie, believe it or not.  And my thought on the matter was that having a folder icon with no plus or minus signs next to it is going to be more confusing, than having an expanding folder icon that shows (None) when you open it.  So, I decided to make it this way, and I'm going to stand by my decision.  Also, this is too minor a point to make it an option to behave one way or the other.<br>
<br>
As for putting the number of files next to the folder.  With the current design, the contents of the folder are only scanned when you expand the folder.  Which means the number of files can only appear after you expand the folder, and that might look a bit silly.  Also, what number should go there?  Number of files, of sub-folders, or both?  I'm not sure that I would like every folder name to have a trail of text behind it:<br>
<br>
+ Downloads (15 files; 4 sub-folders)</div>
