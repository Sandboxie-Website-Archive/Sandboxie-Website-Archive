WIN10 PC gives the previously reported "chrome.exe - application error.  The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000005)".  The WIN7 PC gives the previous reported "Aw, Snap! Something went wrong while displaying this webpage."  when try to web browse. Tried uninstalling/clean install of both programs on both PCs- still happens.</div>

Are you using any antivirus software?<br>
Does the issue occur after deleting the contents of your Sandbox? <br>
Does it occur in a new Sandbox with default settings?<br>

Are you using the beta as instructed on the first page of this thread?   [<a href="viewtopicbbe0bbe0.html?p=132028#p132028" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?p=132028#p132028</a>]<br>

I got the WIN7 one working- not sure what I did different, but presume it was operator-induced.<br>
Haven't had a chance to get back to the WIN10 one (belongs to someone else) but they're running AVG Internet Security. I know it was still happening after deleting contents, but can't remember if I made sure the settings were reset too.<br>
<br>
Got the WIN10 working- I thought I had deleted the ini during one of my uninstalls to ensure a clean new installation, but apparently not as I did it once more &amp; with default settings it's working.  So operator-induced too.  Thanks for your help!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi, <br>
<br>
I have the same problem with the latest version of Chrome not working at all -- <em>and</em> the well-known issues with the latest Firefox as well. (Windows 8.1 64-bit.)<br>
<br>
I know about the workarounds like "--no-sandbox" and "security.sandbox.content.level", but I don't feel too well having to disable those useful internal security features of my browsers.<br>
<br>
Also, I do not want to use beta software for something as important as Sandboxie, my "shield" against the "evil guys" in the Internet. I would really appreciate it if you could release a new version of Sandboxie soon. <br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

<br>
It happens in any sandbox, new or old. It will happen in the latest version (5.23.6) as well. I have found out that it's caused by enabling any feature in Sandboxie that 'automatically' launches the application in a sandbox. If I manually right click on a shortcut for Chrome and open it to run inside any sandbox it will allow me to connect to any webpages again. I usually use a pinned Chrome shortcut on my taskbar to launch it, and also enable "Force Google Chrome to run in this sandbox" setting inside the "Applications" settings window.</div>
