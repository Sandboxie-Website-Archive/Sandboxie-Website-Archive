				<h3>Suspect cause of problem is not version-dependent?</h3>

				<div class="content">I don't think this is a <span style="color: darkblue"><em>[Sandboxie]</em></span> version-dependent problem.  <span style="color: darkblue"><em>[But possibly an IE version-dependent problem?]</em></span><br>
<br>
Interesting to see <a href="http://sandboxie.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=768&amp;highlight=" class="postlink">this topic</a> opened again, because I have an idea what's happening but never consistently overcame it.  Perhaps the second time is a charm, I hope?<br>
<br>
I think it's a cookie retention and recognition problem.  The automatic log-on requires a cookie and a pointer to the cookie in the index.dat file.<br>
<br>
OwenBurnett doesn't give us his Sandboxie settings, so I can't be sure what is happening when he exits sandboxed programs.  I have have Sandboxie set to clear the box when all sandboxed programs teminate, so I'll assume this is the case.  Or, OwenBurnett may be getting the problem in some other way.<br>
<br>
It is possible to retain log-on ID cookes, but not the pointers in the index.dat file.  You can save it, but without effect, because this is a locked file.  You would have to stop Windows to save it.  So without the pointer pointing to the log-on cookie, I believe, even if you saved the cookie it would do no good.<br>
<br>
To go farther, I THINK (don't hold me to this, unless Tzuk verifies it) if you did manage to overwrite the index.dat file, the one from the sandbox may only contain pointers to the cookies received during that session.  Unless you could concatenate the existing and new index.dat files, you (possibly) could lose all that went before, causing other problems.<br>
<br>
As a work-around, (see Tzuk's suggestion, link to prior thread) I have tried copying the URL of the log-on page, and opening an unsandboxed instance of MSIE, doing the log-on, trying to get the right cookie into the cookie folder and get its pointer into the "real" index.dat file, then getting out of the unsandboxed IE and returning to the safe one.<br>
<br>
 <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> So, the result?  It doesn't work consistently -- I am still manually re-entering my log-on details.  I have given up for now, so perhaps there will be further insight the second time around, from others?<br>
<br>
As per Tzuk's suggestion (see link), I did get it to work for Google preferences, but for some other sites, it fails.  No idea why.  Maybe there's a special sequence that must be followed?<br>
<br>
If losing automatic log-ons is the price to pay for hours of disinfecting the operating system with half a dozen utilities, so be it.  <br>
 <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> But I would really love to get the automatic log-ins back, if possible.  Any ideas??<br>
<br>
<span style="color: darkblue"><em>P.S.:  When going back-and-forth between sandboxed-unsandboxed instances of the browser to set desired log-on cookies and update the index.dat file, it may work better if the sandboxed browser is completely terminated, and not left running.  I may not have always been doing this.</em></span></div>

				<div class="content">I have the same issue. My settings are set at the default ones. I first noticed this when I would check "SiteAdvisor" (<a href="http://www.siteadvisor.com/" class="postlink">www.siteadvisor.com</a>). When McAfee bought them, they started putting a nagging web page trying to get you to upgrade to the paid version before you can get info on the site you were looking up.<br>
<br>
It says on the nag page that if you have cookies enabled, you will only see this page once. I noticed I was seeing it time after time.<br>
<br>
I also all other auto-login places like Yahoo Mail and forums (yes, even here) I have to log in everytime, if I empty my sandbox and come back to the site.<br>
<br>
My solution was what was suggested before. I use Firefox, but it works the same with IE. I just launch Firefox outside the sandbox and log into my sites. The cookies then are retained and if you launch the browser within the sandbox, it will auto-login within those forums and sites.<br>
<br>
What may be the issue of inconsistency of this is the fact that some cookies are set to expire at different times. An example of this is Yahoo Mail, where the cookie is set to expire 24 hours after login. So I have to re-set the cookie after that time if I don't want to relogin every time I empty my sandbox.<br>
<br>
I just assumed this is the way Sandboxie is supposed to work. One of the outstanding components of Sandboxie is privacy. I want the cookies that I accumulated during a sandbox session to go away when I empty the sandbox.<br>
<br>
I saw an article about several websites that were storing information such as login and credit card information on plain text non-encrypted cookies, leaving the user vulnerable to their information being stolen.<br>
<br>
I like the idea that privacy issues are deleted with the sandbox.<br>
<br>
What I may mention is that I have, in scanning with AVG Anti-Spyware, picked up some tracking cookies, but I am not sure if those are retained from the sandbox, or some I picked up outside the sandbox.</div>

That just happened to me now.  In my case, this was related to the SbieSvc being temporarily stopped.<br>
<br>
Perhaps this is the cause of the problem also in your case.<br>

I looked into my task Info app. and the SbieSvc was running already since some minute. It wasn't stopped! An restart of the service also didn't helped the datas ware gone.<br>
The files in the samdboxe like coocies looks ok (there are there and are not empty).<br>
I tryed to reproduce the data lost by fastly restarrting the service and starting IE and even starting IF when the service was stopped, after error messages satrting the service, and after this using the IE.<br>
Nothing i can't reproduce the data lost this way.<br>
