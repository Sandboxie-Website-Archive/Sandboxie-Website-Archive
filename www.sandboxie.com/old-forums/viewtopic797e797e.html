<br>
this is to say thank you very much for this wonderful software, in this day and age its hard to believe that this type of program is given away for free, i have been looking for a long time for a "working" and "usable" sandbox system and i have to say this is the best...<br>
<br>
one suggestions though please, how about putting all the set file, set sandbox, ...and all that in the option section into one group (like preferences for instance) and tabbing them.<br>
<br>
the program is sound, but the interface will need some cosmetic changes to please novices but at the end of the day, when the program works, thats all that matters.<br>
<br>
all the best.<br>
<br>
ps, i love the pizza slice icon by the way, and hey thats not a pizza slice its a sandbox!</div>
