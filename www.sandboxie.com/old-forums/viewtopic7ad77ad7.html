				<h3>NoScript and uBlock [Firefox config]</h3>

				<div class="content">So before Firefox 57 I had an working local config for NoScript and uBlock.<br>
I have for quite a while now been trying to fix it for Firefox 57 but to no avail.<br>
<br>
I prefer not to have Firefox installed inside Sandboxie but just run trough Sandboxie.<br>
And have as little files "white-listed" as possible.<br>
<br>
Before Firefox 57<br>
"White-listing"<br>
Profiles\*\prefs.js for NoScript<br>
Profiles\*\extension-data\ublock0.sqlite for uBblock<br>
<br>
Worked just fine. Now it doesn't.<br>
<br>
I changed uBlock to this:<br>
<br>
Profiles\*\browser-extension-data\<a href="mailto:uBlock0@raymondhill.net">uBlock0@raymondhill.net</a>\storage.js<br>
<br>
And it looked like it worked since the settings looks like they're changed after closing.<br>
But the settings doesn't actually do anything. So I'm guessing theres's another file.<br>
<br>
With NoScript I have no idea. Can't find a file that changes when using NoScript. That has anything to do with NoScript.<br>
I tried to google but could only find the old profiles prior to 57. Thank you.</div>

Read the thread posted by Barb, but I ll make it easier for you. For NoScript, allow Firefox Direct file access to "storage-sync.sqlite", that file is where NoScript saves data in Firefox 57. Thats all you need to do. This file gets created when you install NoScript. Not many, but there are a few other extensions that also save data in storage-sync.sqlite.<br>
<br>
About Ublock. I am not using adblockers as NoScript pretty much gets rid of most of them but I believe in Firefox 57, UBO is saving data in \browser-extension-data\<a href="mailto:uBlock0@raymondhill.net">uBlock0@raymondhill.net</a>\storage.js<br>
