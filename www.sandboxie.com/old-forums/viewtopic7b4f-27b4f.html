What extensions are installed on your browser (if any) at the time of the crash? <br>

altae, perhaps you should test using a new Firefox profile. You might also like to switch to the 32 bits version of Firefox, thats what I am using despite my W10 being 64 bits. I have been using W10 for 6 months, as of yet, Firefox hasn't crashed once. FWIW, of your addons, I use NoScript and used it along Sandboxie forever, never an issue. Also, even though I dont maintain Video DownloadHelper installed, I install it sandboxed sometimes, being doing that lately, I cant see any issue  with SBIE.<br>

Wekebu, you should test using a new Firefox profile. And, have you done the workarounds posted earlier in this thread? You must try them, they work for most people.<br>

				<div class="content">Hi, just to say I have been experiencing crashes with firefox, the lowering of security.sandbox.content to level 2 seems to have fixed the problem.  It is very reassuring that solutions are found and  problems are being fixed quickly, including the recent windows 7  update problem. To some people ( myself included ) S.B is there main defence against malware. Please keep up the great work , seriously appreciated  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>

				<h3>Firefox Quantum (57.0+) crashes inside Sandboxie and launches CrashReporter.exe</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Fri Jan 26, 2018 12:36 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>allank</strong></div>
				<div class="content"><strong>Symptoms:</strong><br>
<br>
I have not been able to run Firefox inside Sandboxie since the first release of Quantum (57.0).  Whenever I run it, it immediately crashes and launches the crash reporter.  This is slightly different from the other thread on Firefox 57 where there is a crashed tab message, which is why I am opening a new thread.  <br>
<br>
<strong>Attempted fixes:</strong><br>
<br>
I have tried changing the security level as mentioned in that thread. <br>
<br>
I also tried changing browser.tabs.remote.autostart and browser.tabs.remote.autostart.2 as mentioned in that thread.<br>
<br>
I have also tried creating a new sandbox with default settings as suggested in that thread.  <br>
<br>
And this morning, I uninstalled Sanboxie (allowing it to delete my settings) and reinstalled Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
<strong>System information: </strong><br>
<br>
Windows 7 Professional 64-bit <br>
Sandboxie 5.23.3 64-bit Beta<br>
-	This was installed to get the Program Compatibility fix.<br>
-	I am using the clean, default Sandbox.<br>
Firefox 58.0 64-bit<br>
Symantec Endpoint version 14.0.2415.0200<br>

<br>
After changing the sandbox content level and also multiprocess, did you ensure that the changes were still present after relaunching Firefox (all this needs to be done outside Sandboxie).  ? <br>
<br>
Are you using any extensions? <br>
<br>
Have you tried creating a new Firefox profile, applying the changes and testing it inside a new Sandbox with default settings?<br>
<br>
Regarding Symantec, you will need to apply a workaround in order for it to work with Sbie:<br>
<a href="viewtopic4aca-24aca.html?p=130164#p130164" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?p=130164#p130164</a><br>
<br>
If after following all the steps above, the problem persists, please provide the Firefox crash dump :<br>
<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Breakpad" class="postlink">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Breakpad</a><br>
Along with the results or running Resource Access Monitor:<br>
<a href="../ResourceAccessMonitor.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/ResourceAccessMonitor</a><br>
Copy/paste the output here, highlight it and click on the "&lt;/&gt;" button to format it. <br>

<br>
It was the interaction with Symantec.  In my version, the setting is called "Enable Generic Exploit Mitigation".  I've been using Symantec with Sandboxie for years and never had this issue until the day I updated to Firefox Quantum.<br>
<br>
After changing that setting in Symantec and seeing Firefox work in Sandboxie, I undid all of the Firefox changes outside of Sandboxie, deleted the contents of my sandbox, relaunched Firefox in the sandbox and it still worked.  I checked in the sandboxed browser and all of the settings were still at the default, so I will plan to leave them that way.<br>
<br>
As for the interaction with the firewall, is this an issue that will ever get solved or is there a fundamental incompatibility?  Since this is a generic protection in Symantec, it looks like something for which Symantec might need to build in an exception.  Is that accurate?<br>
<br>
Thank you again!  This has plagued me for months!</div>

I thought updating to 58.0 (64b) would cause similar problems - I had reverted to 57.0.3 -, but upon attempting some solutions via FF 'Safe Mode' Firefox auto updated me to 58 and I now have no issues whatsoever. Except the sound problem. Even after I added uBlock Origin, no issues now. <br>
<br>
I'll t-shoot the no sound fixes when I have time. Don't know but I suspect new code fixed things. I'm running SB ver 5.22 (64b) since checking for updates put me there (and also Avast).<br>
<br>
Hope that helps,<br>
