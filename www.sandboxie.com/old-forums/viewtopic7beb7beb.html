				<h3>[.01] Paste not working in sandboxed browsers</h3>

				<div class="content">Sandboxie 4.02 64bit<br>
Win7 Home Prem 64bit<br>
<br>
When trying to paste from the clipboard it has stopped working in sandboxed browsers.<br>
Works fine when browsers aren't sandboxed.<br>
<br>
The same problem is in Firefox and Comodo Dragon. Copy works but not paste. Works fine in Notepad.<br>
<br>
I was using Ditto for a long time and it was fine. Since this problem I've uninstalled Ditto in case it was the problem. It's still the same.<br>
<br>
Un sandboxed fine.<br>
Sandboxed problem.<br>
<br>
I can't remember if it's since updating Sandboxie or not, but it's very recent.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions?<br>
<br>
Love Sandboxie and been using it for a long time without problems. I don't understand this copy n paste problem though.<br>
Thanks</div>

				<div class="content">I have a similar problem.  Since updating to 4.02 I cannot paste text or urls into a Sandboxed JDownloader. <br>
I have tried several suggestions on this forum, but nothing seems to cure the problem.<br>
<br>
Copy &amp; Paste still works in Firefox 21.0 and Notepad etc.<br>
<br>
Everything worked OK with 3.76.   If I want to revert to 3.76 can I just install it over the top of 4.02?<br>
<br>
Any help would be appreciated, thanks.<br>

				<div class="content">A similar problem here:<br>
<br>
I use to insert text from Word documents directly into the pages of a Wiki (not Wikipedia) by copy and paste (within my browser [Firefox]). Since using Sandboxie 4.02 pasting itself continues to work, but some (important for me) formatting details (like tables, underlining of words, ...) are now lost when pasting into the Wiki page.<br>
<br>
The issue is without doubt caused by version 4.02 because formatting is kept (as usual)<br>
- when pasting the text into the Wiki outside of Sandboxie (that means: Firefox running outside of Sandboxie)<br>
- when pasting text and using the older version 3.76.<br>
<br>
The problem appears in version 4.02 both in a sandbox with standard configuration and in a sandbox with my specific configuration.<br>
<br>
My browser is Firefox 21.0, my version of Word is 2002, SP 3.<br>
<br>
Concerning the questions above:<br>
<br>
- The problem remains, even when the Accessibility feature is activated.<br>
<br>
- Also there is in my case no connection with the question if Sandboxie is set to "deny" in some other security software because (as written above) the problem appears also in a sandbox with standard configuration.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for your help.</div>

I've checked now only in 3.76 as that's what i'm using. <br>
Accessibility is not on.<br>
No Sandboxie service is denied by security program.</div>

				<div class="content">I just realize that I misunderstood the following question:
<blockquote><div><cite>tzuk wrote:</cite>

<a href="../phpbb/viewtopiccab2.php?t=14831" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=14831</a></div></blockquote>

My answer is the same as Kleary's:
<blockquote><div><cite>Kleary wrote:</cite>
No Sandboxie service is denied by security program.</div></blockquote>

In the meantime I can also partly confirm the problems mentioned by Kleary in his first posting:
<blockquote><div><cite>Kleary wrote:</cite>

Works fine when browsers aren't sandboxed.<br>
<br>
The same problem is in Firefox and Comodo Dragon. Copy works but not paste. </div></blockquote>
 <br>
"Partly" means that pasting sometimes works, sometimes not. For example in my previous posting here in the forum I was not able to paste anything within my post (e.g. a quote of tzuk's questions). The same happened when trying to paste something in another forum. Now - in the meantime - pasting seems to work again without problems, at least here in the Sandboxie Forum. (The problem with the wiki in any case remains.)<br>
<br>
I forgot to mention in my previous posting that I use Windows Home 7 Premium 32 bit.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I should also add that sometimes (quite often) I use a clipboard manager called <em>"Ethervane Echo"</em> (<a href="http://www.tranglos.com/echo/" class="postlink">http://www.tranglos.com/echo/</a>). But this seems to be of no influence on the issue with missing or "wrong" (= unformatted) pasting: The problems appear with and without using this clipboard manager.</div>

That seems to be a similar problem to mine (described above): text is kept but formatting is lost.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink">  (In my case it concerns the copying of text from a word document to a website.)<br>
<br>
But I am optimistic that tzuk will be able to help us with his next beta version:
