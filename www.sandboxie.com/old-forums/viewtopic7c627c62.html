				<div class="content">So I hate buying programs I won't lie I much prefer to buy pizzas and what not.<br>
<br>
However I have been using SandBoxie for years and considered buying it many times (I even made a topic asking about buying it a few years back but decided not to because of *online activation* scared me off) but I always put it off since it crossed the line for me (I don't buy programs remember I prefer to buy pizzas!) so today I decided to bite the bullet and see what would happen.....<br>
<br>
As it turns out the process was very simple and took only 30 seconds (I was kinda worried that it was asking for delivery address since I wanted immediate activation) and now I can use finally start placing all my apps into unique SandBoxie instead of having one *mega* sandbox for everything.<br>
<br>
The activation was immediate (within 15 seconds of paying).<br>
<br>
Overall SandBoxie is an epic program that deserves buying I am naturally hesitant about buying apps but SandBoxie was worth it and I recommend others do the same!.<br>
<br>
(As a side note I only bought it since they returned Life time licenses! About time!)</div>
