				<div class="content">Hey, <br>
I got since yesterday everytime a game crash after a few minutes. <br>
Before the new patch from Wednesday in Europe, everything runs fine. <br>
<br>
The game crash after 3-5 Minutes with an Access_Violation. <br>
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/aCvoF" class="postlink">http://imgur.com/a/aCvoF</a> <br>
This is a picture of a Crash. I need to play a instance with Sandboxie, because my wife plays on the same Computer like me. We play since 6 months on this Setup and never have trouble like now. Re-Installed the game, deleting the folders Cache and Wtf like Blizz told but nothing helps.<br>
If you need information about the System, i can get it later.<br>
<br>
Maybe, somebody can help here <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

<br>
Please provide this information so that we can review it:<br>

<br>
Does the game work fine outside Sandboxie? <br>
Please test it in a new Sandbox with default settings to see if that makes a difference.<br>
<br>

				<div class="content">It's been a few years since I touched WoW but even after Battle.net got added you were able to bypass the launcher with a shortcut flag and launch more than one instance, unless I am recalling wrong.<br>
<br>
Does the error still occur if you only run the one instance sandboxed?</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
Thanks for the fast help. I run a Win 10 pro 64Bit Version with a 5.20 sandboxie Version and using Kaspersky total Security as anti vir. <br>
Its just World of Warcraft with the issues. Outside of sandboxie it works fine. On tuesday everything works fine.<br>
<br>
<br>
With the launcher Option to start another application of wow doesn't work for me. The Second Player will get a large "could not load because…" and a ton of Problems. <br>
<br>
<br>
Greetings</div>

<br>
I tested World of Warcraft  Starter Edition v7.3.2.25549 + Sbie 5.23.1 Beta + Wino 10- x64.<br>
I was able to create a character and finish the first quest, and after 3 minutes I got the crash: "Error #138 (Ox8510008a) Fatal Exception ...Access_Violation...."<br>
<br>
I am not sure if this will be addressed at any point, but I will bring it up to the devs. <br>
<br>
Regarding trying to launch multiple versions of the game, please see Battle.net's official response about it:<br>
<a href="https://us.battle.net/forums/en/bnet/topic/20745095739#7" class="postlink">https://us.battle.net/forums/en/bnet/to ... 45095739#7</a><br>
Sandboxie was not designed to bypass software restrictions.<br>
<br>

Thanks for testing Barb. New guy to the forums but wanted to get in on the discussion as this is driving me nuts! Same error I am seeing yet it was working without issues until 20th November. I went on holiday, came back to this beast of a problem. Oh boy. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"><br>
<br>
I also tested with Sbie 5.22 and 5.18 for good measure. Latest version of WoW on my end is Nov 21st. Suspect it is something Blizzard have implemented yet I can't see anything in the hotfix/patch notes to support this.<br>
<br>
Been working on this all day, even tried expanding sandbox size to 99 GB and placing the entire 45 GB WoW folder inside (I am not an expert user so this could be rather dumb). Tried things like Drop Rights as well. Issue is not present when not using sbie.</div>
