				<div class="content">I want to disable all access to the Pale Moon folder, but allow access to two other folders from my profile in Pale Moon. I simply don't know how to do this looking at the options. I know how to disable all access to the Pale Moon folder, but how to add folders I don't know. I go under Folders and click Add and nothing happens for me to add the two folders I want.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello John connor,<br>
<br>
If you want to allow direct access to the folders (meaning allowing Sandboxie to modify those locations on your host), please try this:<br>
<a href="../ResourceAccessSettings.html#file" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/ResourceAccessSettings#file</a><br>
<br>
Right-Click on your Sandbox --&gt; Sandbox Settings---&gt; Resource Access --&gt; File Access --&gt; Direct Access<br>
Click Add Program to choose the program that should have access to those locations (in this case, Pale Moon). <br>
Hit Add and select the folders you want that program to be able to access.<br>
Hit Apply and Ok your way out<br>
Configure --&gt; Reload Configuration.<br>
<br>
Also, if you are trying to access bookmarks/history, etc , there are templates in Sandboxie that will help you:<br>
Right-Click on your Sandbox --&gt; Sandbox Settings---&gt; Applications---&gt;Web Browser ---&gt; Firefox<br>
Scroll down until finding the Pale Moon options.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks. I had two Pale Moons's show up on choosing the program. There was Pale Moon and Palemoon.exe. I chose Palemoon.exe. Is that correct?</div>

<br>
Palemoon.exe should be fine.  Did the settings work? <br>

				<div class="content">I have another question. I need to grant access to Pale Moon's dictionary file so that when I add words via right click to the dictionary they stick on Sandboxie close. I can't add the path to the dictionary as it resides in the Programs folder and when I press Add all I see is Desktop and my profile name on Windows. No C drive is present to Nav to.</div>

<br>
Is this what you are seeing?<br>
<a href="viewtopic91499149.html?f=17&amp;t=24574&amp;p=129207&amp;hilit=desktop+icons+80#p128795" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=24574&amp;p=129207&amp;hil ... 80#p128795</a><br>
If so, try removing icons from your Desktop and re-try (see the last response in the thread).<br>
<br>
Otherwise, you can add any changes directly to the Sandboxie configuration file:<br>
Configure---&gt; Edit Configuration<br>
<br>
For example, to give direct access to the entire PaleMoon profile folder, you can do this:<br>
OpenFilePath=palemoon.exe,%Tmpl.PaleMoon%\ <br>
Modify the path after "palemoon.exe," to add a specific location of your choice. <br>
<br>

Barb.-</div>

				<div class="content">Okay, yes, I have a lot of icons on the desktop, but I really don't want to remove them as I use all those short cuts. I did use the Edit/Add feature to add the path to the dictionary files, but it doesn't seem like the words that I right click and add to the dictionary in Pale Moon get added. So I'm not sure if that's the correct file. The reason why I just don't grant access to the entire Pale Moon folder is for security. I have been getting a lot of meta data stored on the computer if I grant Sandboxie permission to the entire PM folder, but when I tailor the Sandboxie settings for PM I insure meta data is always contained in the sandbox.<br>
<br>
I'll do some more research here on the dictionary and ask over at the Pale Moon forum.</div>
