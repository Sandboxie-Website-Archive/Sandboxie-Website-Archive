				<div class="content">New Delete Command for Eraser v6.2.0.2962 and Sandboxie<br>
Tested with Sandboxie v4.16 and v4.17 on 64-bit Win 8.1<br>
<span style="color: #FF0000">Edit</span> Also works with Eraser v6.2.0.2963 and 6.2.0.2967, but does NOT work for me with 6.2.0.2969. On 6.2.0.2969 it leaves behind the renamed sandbox folder "__Delete_xxxxx_xxxxxxxx" <span style="color: #FF0000"> /Edit</span><br>
<br>
Copy all of the text from this post to your Clipboard, and then Paste it into a Notepad document, so that you will have it available when you are off-line.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #FF0000">Edit</span>: I should mention that the command lines assume that the "Eraser.exe" program file is located at "C:\Program Files\Eraser\Eraser.exe". If that's not correct for your computer, then the path inside of the following command lines must be corrected.<span style="color: #FF0000"> /Edit</span><br>
<br>
Choose from these two eraser methods...<br>
<br>
Command line for <span style="text-decoration: underline">3 Pass deletion - DOD /E method</span> (This is the usual method used by Sandboxie):
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>"C:\Program Files\Eraser\Eraser.exe" erase /quiet /method=ecbf4998-0b4f-445c-9a06-23627659e419 dir="%SANDBOX%"
</code></pre></div>
Command line for <span style="text-decoration: underline">1 Pass deletion with PseudoRandom Data</span> (A quicker method that I use, and all that's really needed):
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>"C:\Program Files\Eraser\Eraser.exe" erase /quiet /method=bf8ba267-231a-4085-9bf9-204de65a6641 dir="%SANDBOX%"
</code></pre></div>
Decide which of the above erase methods you will use (1 Pass or 3 Pass), and have the Notepad document open so you can Copy to the Clipboard.<br>
<br>
For each sandbox where you use Eraser v6.2 for secure deletion:<br>
(Right-click the sandbox name) &gt; Sandbox Settings &gt; Delete &gt; Delete Command<br>
<br>
In the "Delete Command" box, use the arrow keys or your mouse to select everything in the box, and then delete it by pressing the &lt;Delete&gt; key on your keyboard.<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Text in that box extends beyond what you can see, so make sure that it has all been deleted</span>.<br>
Paste the new command line of your choice from above into the Delete Command  box, and Click OK to close the Sandbox Settings window.<br>
<br>
Repeat for the next sandbox.<br>
<br>
<br>
NOTES:<br>
If you have multiple sandboxes that use Eraser v6.2, you could use:<br>
Sandboxie Control window &gt; Configure &gt; Edit Configuration<br>
Scroll down to each "DeleteCommand=..." line and replace the line with the new DeleteCommand=..." line of your choice:<br>
<br>
Either the 3 Pass method that's usually used by Sandboxie:<br>
<br>
DeleteCommand="C:\Program Files\Eraser\Eraser.exe" erase /quiet /method=ecbf4998-0b4f-445c-9a06-23627659e419 dir="%SANDBOX%"<br>
<br>
Or the 1 Pass method:<br>
<br>
DeleteCommand="C:\Program Files\Eraser\Eraser.exe" erase /quiet /method=bf8ba267-231a-4085-9bf9-204de65a6641 dir="%SANDBOX%"<br>
 <br>
<span style="color: #FF0000">Edit</span> Here's an example using <span style="color: #4000FF">methodName</span>:<br>
<br>
DeleteCommand="C:\Program Files\Eraser\Eraser.exe" erase /quiet /methodName=Pseudorandom data dir="%SANDBOX%"<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #FF0000"> /Edit</span><br>
------<br>
Justification for only using 1 Pass deletion -<br>
At the bottom of Peter Gutmann's paper on Secure Deletion Methods:<br>
<a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html#Epilogue" class="postlink">https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/ ... l#Epilogue</a><br>
Why Eraser still sets 35-Pass Gutmann method as the default setting when installing Eraser is a mystery to me.<br>

    Only erasure methods labelled "U" can be used to erase unused disk space.

  /schedule           The schedule the task will follow. The value must be one of:
    now               The task will be queued for immediate execution.
    manually          The task will be created but not queued for execution.
    restart           The task will be queued for execution when the computer is next restarted.
                      This parameter is only valid for use with "addtask".

  target is one or more of:
    file                Erases the specified file
      argument: file=&lt;path&gt;
    dir                 Erases files and folders in the directory
      arguments: dir=&lt;directory&gt;[,-excludeMask][,+includeMask][,deleteIfEmpty[=true|false]]
        excludeMask     A wildcard expression for files and folders to exclude.
        includeMask     A wildcard expression for files and folders to include.
                        The include mask is applied before the exclude mask.
        deleteIfEmpty   Deletes the folder at the end of the erasure if it is
                        empty. If this parameter is not specified, it defaults to true.
    recyclebin          Erases files and folders in the recycle bin
    unused              Erases unused space in the volume.
      arguments: unused=&lt;drive&gt;[,clusterTips[=(true|false)]]
      clusterTips     If specified, the drive's files will have their cluster tips erased.
                      This parameter accepts a Boolean value (true/false) as an argument;
                      if none is specified true is assumed.
    move                Securely moves a file/directory to a new location
      arguments: move=&lt;source&gt;|&lt;destination&gt;
    drive               Erases partitions, volumes or drives
      arguments:
        drive=\Device\Harddisk&lt;index&gt;
        drive=\\.\PhysicalDrive&lt;index&gt;
        drive=\\?\Volume&lt;guid&gt;

parameters for importtasklist:
  eraser importtasklist &lt;file&gt;[...]

    file               A list of one or more files to import.

All arguments are case sensitive.

Response files can be used for very long command lines (generally, anything
involving more than 32,000 characters.) Response files are used by prepending
"@" to the path to the file, and passing it into the command line. The
contents of the response files' will be substituted at the same position into
the command line.</code></pre></div>

I have that version on my notebook now, so I'm going to see if I can figure out what has changed with the command line.</div>

				<div class="content">I was not able to get Eraser 6.2.0.2969 to work correctly from within Sandboxie.<br>
However, 6.2.0.2967 does seem to work OK.<br>
<br>
Using 6.2.0.2969:<br>
DeleteCommand="C:\Program Files\Eraser\Eraser.exe" erase /quiet /method=bf8ba267-231a-4085-9bf9-204de65a6641 dir="%SANDBOX%"<br>
<br>
Capturing the commands using Process Monitor...<br>
The resultant command to run Eraser was:<br>
"C:\Program Files\Eraser\Eraser.exe" erase /quiet /method=bf8ba267-231a-4085-9bf9-204de65a6641 dir="C:\Sandbox\Paul\__Delete_Firefox_01D07ACDF5BAD900"<br>
<br>
It looks perfect to me, but it did not work when Sandboxie tried to Delete Contents with 6.2.0.2969.<br>
Since that command does work in previous Eraser versions, it would seem that Eraser might be at fault.<br>
<br>
However, the above command line <span style="text-decoration: underline">did work</span> when it I ran it in a command window.<br>
That reminds me of another thread in the forum where it was reported that the DeleteCommand did not work from Sandboxie, but it did work from a command window.</div>

I have been struggling with this for over a year following an update. I have spent ages searching and trying different things then gave up in despair. I tried again today and found your post that has worked.<br>
<br>
Sandboxie was not clearing the folder and I had to use CCleaner to fully clean up.<br>
<br>
<strong>You are a star!!!</strong><br>
<br>
Merry Christmas and a very happy New Year.<br>

Thanks again.</div>
