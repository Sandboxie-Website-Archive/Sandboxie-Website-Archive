				<div class="content">I know I can now use SBIE in Win8.1, but I still only use it my XP VM.   4.18 still working flawlessly for me.   Thanks to the developers for their continued support of a very old OS.   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

				<div class="content">I haven't (yet) upgraded from the last stable release on my XP system but I join in thanking the Invincea team for keeping the good going for XP.  While my uses for that machine are somewhat limited these days, it's good to know it's still covered by the best single piece of security software out there, imho.</div>

				<div class="content">I agree with Blues and Lylejk. I use Sandboxie in both of my computers, a W7 laptop and an XP desktop. The computer that I go hard at it with is the XP. And there is nothing that I do in that computer that I don't do it under Sandboxie. Sandboxie works in my XP as good or better than in the W7. I like to thank Invincea for keep supporting XP and for maintaining same quality of support as when Tzuk was here.<br>

				<div class="content">I must say I'm surprised they still support XP. So thank you. Things may change when Windows 10 RTM will be released (29.06).</div>

				<div class="content">More music to my ears.  Really SBIE is pretty much why I still use XP in a virtual machine since doing so, in essence, makes it double-sandboxed.   I don't care how many patches Microsoft does for it's OS, there is only one way to protect it; it's to completely isolate it (well try to anyway) from online browsing.    Of course SBIE doesn't protect against key loggers, but the way I usi my VM along with SBIE hopefully mitigates my system from worry.   Thanks again for sharing that Craig.    <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>
