				<div class="content">Ok, assuming you both @Invinceas done it right way, then there must be something specific in our OS configurations. I do not have 'Windows search' and 'Indexing service' modules because I uninstalled them using add/remove Windows features. Desktop path is indexed by default I guess (since it's in user directory).<br>
Prefetch uses default settings. Duno what else may be a problem since I was able to reproduce it on XP machine with very little software installed and almost unchanged sandboxie configuration.<br>
<br>
Craig@: Would you like me to try to reproduce this using TeamViewer on your test machine? CCleaner has full installer, slime installer and portable version. Which one have you used?<br>
<br>
I'm able to change my OS language to english if it may help in any way.</div>

@Dun. As you yourself have said, this thing has been like that for a long time. I ll say its been like that forever. It might even work like that by design. I don't know. Is it worth changing it? I don't know. But to me personally, this is nothing.<br>

				<div class="content">I agree with Bo, this never bothered me either. It would be a real problem if it was vice-versa (thing running unsandboxed in a forced folder). So what I want to be in the sandbox I install in the sandbox - and it stays there. What I want to be in the real system I install outside of the sandbox - and it stays there.</div>

Bellzemos@: Ok, the example: Some people use Chrome, I don't. If I don't use Chrome, can I say chrome issues does not bother me? What if I would like to come back to Chrome? What if Chrome issues may affect other things we currently don't know?<br>

Ok, please let me remind you about my thread I posted a moment before this one you're reading currently. <a href="viewtopic6e6a6e6a.php?f=11&amp;t=21318&amp;p=110135" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 8&amp;p=110135</a><br>
According to the linked thread please feel free to set the folder where you have firefox installed as forced... or not.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, I agree with you - when it's vice-versa it is a huge problem. Once something weird happened to me too:<br>

<br>
But other than that and once before Sandboxie opening an offline html file unsadboxed (even though all the web browsers are always forced on my computer) I think it's really secure. I couldn't believe my eyes when that happened and have nevert figured it out. It was a maual file on a CD that came with the new printer. Anyway, that was like a year ago and I never had any issues since.</div>

Strange, I tried to replicate your tests using Skype and CCleaner and they installed fine but when I copied their program folder to desktop and tried to run the program exe file, Windows gave me a error message that the program has stopped working. So I am not sure how you managed to run the program "normally". <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes"> <br>
<br>
So it may be really better to test using a program like irfanview where all the files are created in the program folder itself (be sure to select to use the .ini to be created in the program folder). <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>

Unless that was just a poor choice of wording you did it wrong. It's when you <em><span style="text-decoration: underline">cut and paste</span></em> the entire <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">FOLDER</span></strong> that was set as forced in sbie and that the program was initially run from to a new location, not *just* the exes. =(</div>

Yes, it can be any program which can start inside sandbox. However yes, latest CCleaner v5 has some issues <a href="viewtopicd884d884.html?p=110181#p110181" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 81#p110181</a>

I'm working on trying to recreate this in 7 (64/32) and in 8.1 to see if I can get it to reproduce as well.</div>

Bo, you bring up a interesting point. Could it be related to the overall design underpinnings from the start? Possibly.</div>

Yes, I am getting the same as Curt got yesterday afternoon running Skype (Cut/Paste entire folder to the desktop.) It's looking for a path. ProcMon is stating "Path not found.."</div>
