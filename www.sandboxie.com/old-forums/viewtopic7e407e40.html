				<div class="content">It has just occurred to me that it would be appropriate to recognise the progress that Tzuk has made since I first played with sandboxie (ver 2.6) in Aug/Sept 2006.<br>
<br>
At that time my diaries were full of descriptions of what I did to the Sandboxie.ini file to try to get downloaded files and my e-mail messages back into my main system. This also involved registry tweaks to redefine shell folders etc. etc. etc.<br>
<br>
Now I just download the latest version, run the installation file - check that my browser and mail client are properly set up and away I go to the www in near perfect security.<br>
<br>
Thanks Tzuk for a really valuable contribution to safe surfing.<br>
