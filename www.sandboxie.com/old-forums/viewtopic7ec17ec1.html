				<h3>Quick question about sandboxie license [SOLVED]</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sun Sep 10, 2017 5:04 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I have a few quick questions in regards with the lifetime license of sandboxie that my dad gave me a few months back.<br>
<br>
1.  My question is if that license was purchased with version 5.18 of sandboxie, will that license work with lower versions aswell like for example <br>
    version 5.10 or just 5.18 and above?<br>
2. I'm using version 5.20 now, how do I clear my license in order to transfer it to another PC?<br>
3. I've read somewhere that I can use my license with the PC's I own, this means one at a time right? (just making sure) <br>
3. How come my sandboxie says"Your product key does not have an expiration date" but also says "The license of sandboxie will be reactivated in XXX<br>
    days"? What does it mean? Will my license expire or something?<br>
<br>
Ahm thats is all I can think for now, so sorry if I got weird questions about sandboxie but I really love sandboxie it is simply awesome. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
All help is highly appreciated. Thank you.<br>
<br>

Hi Jhen:<br>
1. If your license has not been compromised, it should work with any Sandboxie version, older or newer than 5.18.<br>
2.  Click Help&gt;Register Sandboxie &gt;OK, Click Clear License Information.<br>
3. Legacy licenses can be used on any computer you personally own. Otherwise, you can use it in one computer only. If it was purchased recently, then its the latter type. If it was purchased like 5 years ago, its legacy. To confirm what you got, you can send an email with your questions to:<br>
<br>
<a href="mailto:support@sandboxie.com">support@sandboxie.com</a><br>
<br>
4. Your license is not going to expire. Sandboxie checks the license against their server after 180 days or before, if and when you upgrade your Sandboxie version.<br>

Hi Bo,<br>
<br>
Thank you so much for answering my query regarding Sandboxie. <br>
I think the Sanboxie license that I have now was purchased last April of this year by my dad, therefore that means my license in not a legacy license.<br>
So even though mine is not a legacy license and it is for one computer only, can I still use it on a second PC? <br>
Of course I need to deactivate it first from actual PC so that I can transfer it right to prevent multiple activations?<br>
<br>
Thank you again.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Jhen</div>

You are welcome, Jhen. You should be fine activating the license in the second computer after deactivating it in the one you have it now.  If you have a problem, contact Barb at the Sandboxie support email address I posted earlier. <br>
