Is this problem specific to TB? I.e., should I add an open "{3480A401-BDE9-4407-BC02-798A866AC051} ShellServiceHostBrokerProvider" to the TB template?</div></blockquote>
Just added {3480A401-BDE9-4407-BC02-798A866AC051} to the COM Access and it worked perfectly! Now when I click a link in Thunderbird, Firefox opens. Curt, you should absolutely add {3480A401-BDE9-4407-BC02-798A866AC051} if this resolves the issue. Thanks to everyone for tracking this fix down!</div>

Windows 10 1607 Enterprise LTSB x64, fresh install of SBIE 5.13.5 with default settings. Haven't tried 5.12.<br>
I've downloaded an unknown executable via Google Chrome, opened a sandboxed Windows Explorer window and tried to execute the file. smartscreen.exe is launched in the sandbox, but nothing appears, just a "busy" cursor. When you try manipulating the Explorer window it will hang.<br>
Anyone else?</div></blockquote>
I don't know why smartscreen.exe is being executed by the sandboxed explorer. This doesn't happen in the host. Just block it from running with ClosedFilePath=C:\Windows\System32\smartscreen.exe</div>

				<div class="content">I've had this issue for a while now.  When running Firefox Developer edition, no pages seem to "paint" after they are loaded.  Type in a URL, hit enter, the title updates, but the page area doesn't refresh and it remains static until you either resize the window or toggle between tabs.  After resize/toggling, the page area updates and the page shows fine.  Any sort of navigation (eg: clicking on links) experience the same issue pretty much making it not usable for typical browsing.<br>
<br>
I only have this issue on the development/nightly version.  I prefer to use that version if possible.  This could possibly mean future issues with later releases, though.</div>

CHXSmartScreen.exe runs with AppContainer integrity level (Modern App sandbox), which probably causes it to fail to launch in SBIE. I haven't tried your workaround, but I assume it will work.</div>

I never see the dialog box you posted -- even outside Sandboxie. Not in my test Win 10 VM nor my regular Win 10 machine.  I'm not sure what setting is preventing this. But, it looks like a Metro dialog so that explains why it isn't working in Sbie.<br>
<br>
In Sbie, smartscreen.exe runs and I get the hang you describe. The work around will prevent explorer from locking up.</div>

<br>
I know that not many users are using PAC (Proxy Auto Config) files or Windows Proxy Auto Detect (WPAD). So you may not be very excited about this fix. But I had to rewrite a fair amount of low-level IPC driver code to fix this issue and it affects all OS's. So we need Beta testers to try this version out to make sure that something else didn't break.<br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>
