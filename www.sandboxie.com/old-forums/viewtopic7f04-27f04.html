				<div class="content">We are unable to repro this in-house because CryptoLocker has evolved and we no longer have the original version used in the demo. But, we have been testing other APIs and I think I know what CryptoLocker was doing.<br>
<br>
The issue here is that any app in the sandbox can see the actual sandbox folder if it traverses down the directory tree using FindFirstFile/FindNextFile.<br>
<br>
E.g. if an app goes searching through the disk, they can go right into C:\Sandbox\admin\DefaultBox, and see everything that is in there. CryptoLocker goes through the entire HD looking for documents and pics. So eventually it will make its way into the real sandbox folder.<br>
<br>
We could prevent this from happening by hooking FindFirstFile/FindNextFile, and blocking the app from seeing into the sandbox folder. But I am not sure how much effort this would require and it could easily be thwarted by unhooking.  As it is now, it is harmless.</div>

				<div class="content">I understand what you mean. The malware starts at root of C drive and starts traversing all folders in hard disk. Then it shows all files being a pic or a document. Therefore the malware did not see sandbox folder but just found it.<br>
<br>
If you find an easy method to implement which allows hiding sandbox container folder without creating incompatibilites then I would go for it. If not, just keep it as it is.<br>
<br>
Thanks for taking care of the issue and finding out what was going on!</div>

Now that it's cleared, can you guys create a new video demo with regards to "Cryptowall"...</div>
