				<div class="content">I would like to especially thank one man, one guy named Tzuk for his unbelievably cool program, but first of all for the updates that he is doing like a machine. So fast, so quick, so it makes us users feel as comfortable as we can imagine,<br>
Thank you for this professional attitude and that' s the sign that you care<br>
<br>
However without us users there would not be these updates possible, so I would like to thank you guys for these things happen and make Tzuk busy as hell <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
I am just a newbie here, am not as experienced as the others maybe, but from what I have experienced so far I can only be satisfied.<br>
Keep up the great job<br>
<br>
Happy New Year    <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>
