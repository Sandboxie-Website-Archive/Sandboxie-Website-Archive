				<div class="content">Hello!<br>
<br>
I'm quite interested in purchasing Sandboxie because of a friend of mine told me that this program can be used to open clients of different programs (computer games for example) and have different IP adresses connected to each client somehow. Can someone please confirm or deny this statement?<br>
<br>
If it is possible, I would love to get a quick tutorial how I can make this a reality for myself. <br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you in advance!</div>

<br>
Sandboxie is not a VM, but an isolation program. You can set internet restrictions (all or nothing type of thing) with this setting:<br>
<a href="../index7ac3.html?RestrictionsSettings" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?Res ... nsSettings</a><br>
<br>
Running multiple instance of a program depends on whether the program allows for it or not.<br>
We have many Steam users that use Sandboxie to achieve that goal, however, not every game will allow it.<br>
<br>
You can search the forum for specific games and see the latest posts regarding them. <br>
If you let us know what are you trying to do, exactly, we will be able to better assist.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>
