				<h3>Copy/duplicate a Sanbox</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Tue Nov 29, 2016 4:54 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Wil70</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Hello, I'm new, just bought 5 licenses for the family, I'm still learning sandboxie so sorry if the answer is already there.<br>
I would like to be able to copy quickly a sandbox (may be right click or from the sandboxie control menu) <br>
<br>
Scenario, I setup my machine, create a sandbox, run a program from a sandbox, now I like how my program is setup but I would like to do more temporary customization of my program, so I would like to be able to copy this sanbox as sanbox_1 and run my program again with some extra customization to it (then sanbox doesn't have the modification but sanbox_1 does have the modification), then when I'm done, I can either delete or not sandbox_1 , I can start again from the original sanbox by copying again) etc......It is almost like creating a children sandbox...I can see this usefulll for many scenarios like QA/testing......<br>
<br>
Question: can I today modify or copy/duplicate a sanbox from C:\Sandbox\user\DefaultBox, or is this folder private to sanboxie and we shouldn't copy or duplicate things..... <br>
<br>
Thanks for your help<br>
best<br>

Yes, you can copy sandbox folders from inside C:\Sandbox\user, and save the folder somewhere else in the computer and at a later time, copy the saved folder and place it back inside  C:\Sandbox\user. Thats what I do for one particular program which I install in a sandbox that's set not to delete automatically. After installing the program and terminating all programs, I copy the folder of the sandbox where I installed the program and save it to use it at another time.<br>

So I should also be able to copy a sandbox in C:\Sandbox\user to create a duplicate and start to modify the duplicate by using the application, correct?<br>
(so this is like creating a copy or a children in vmware, then I can go back to my none duplicate sandbox, is it correct?)<br>
<br>
Just to make sure if I didn't explain well<br>
I have a sandbox called C:\Sandbox\user\s (This is a setup I like)<br>
duplicate it , so now I have C:\Sandbox\user\s and C:\Sandbox\user\s_copy<br>
I work on s_copy, then when I'm done I can delete it and copy again C:\Sandbox\user\s so I can have a fresh new C:\Sandbox\user\s_copy<br>
That should work correct? (this is like creating a children of a sandbox and using it<br>
<br>
I guess a new feature can be to duplicate from the menu a sandbox and another one but more complicated will be to have a tree of sandbox and optimize the files that are from the parents.....then you can replace vmware?<br>
<br>
thanks<br>

Yes, thats pretty much what I do in a regular basis with one program that I dont keep installed in the system but when I want to use it, I make a copy of the copy that I saved in My documents and place it inside C:\Sandbox\user. After using the program, I either delete the sandbox or not. If I delete it, I again place the copy of the folder next time I want to use the program.<br>

				<div class="content">Ok I have been using it for few days now and thinking more of the feature I really would like to see, basically be able to right click - &gt; create child sandboxie, then I can reset it and it goes to the same state as the parent sandboxie<br>
<br>
Scenario:<br>
I want to test some software but I want to test few scenarios after having modify the software.....<br>
So create a sandboxie_qa_app, install software, right click sandboxie_qa_app -&gt; create child "sandboxie_qa_app_test1"<br>
then again &gt; -create child "sandboxie_qa_app_test2".....<br>
then I can run the app from the divers sandboxie and test diver scenario, if I do a right click -&gt; reset sandboxie, it should get back to the state of its parent automatically. so I can run a new test again as if it was a fresh install of the app to test.<br>
I could even be in a certain state in  "sandboxie_qa_app_test1" and decide to create a child from there and do more testing in this child, if I reset it, then it is back as same state as "sandboxie_qa_app_test1"<br>
<br>
Basically this create a trees of sandboxies for divers tasks.<br>
That can be very powerful for many tasks.<br>
<br>
I understand this shouldn't be too hard as this basically just duplicate/copy state, when reset it just copy over the parent state......<br>
<br>
I hope I explain well but I can see this as a very nice feature enhancement (faster than VM to setup, lighter, nice for QA and many other tasks).....<br>
thanks<br>
