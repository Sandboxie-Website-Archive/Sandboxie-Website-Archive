				<div class="content">Hello.<br>
I've set Sandboxie to force all browsers to run sandboxed, because I think it's the safest way to avoid malware. However, I've recently installed a couple of Chrome apps, and they need to run outside of the sandbox. Is there a way to get them to automatically run outside of the sandbox when I launch them from their shortcuts? I'm worried that if I have to do this manually I may forget, and this would be a problem. I suppose essentially I'm looking for a way to add these Chrome apps (or their shortcuts) as exceptions to my "force all browsers" sandbox.<br>
<br>
I've sort of forgotten how to use Sandboxie, because I've used it for a while with no problems and with no need to interfere! I'm very happy with it. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
Maybe I need to rethink my whole setup?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance to anyone who can come up with any suggestions.</div>

<br>
Chrome Apps require Chrome in order to run, so if Chrome is forced in Sandboxie, its apps will be Sandboxed as well (if they invoke Chrome to start).<br>
<br>
What are your OS, browsers, Sandboxie and Windows versions? <br>
What are the apps that need to run outside Sandboxie? Do they not work inside of it?  Why do you need to run them outside SBIE? <br>
<br>
These 2 options will allow you to run the apps outside Sandboxie, without modifying your Sandboxie settings:<br>
Right-click on the app --&gt; Run Sandboxed ---&gt; Run outside Sandbox.<br>
Hold Ctrl+shift, then right click on the app --&gt; Run Sandboxed. <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
