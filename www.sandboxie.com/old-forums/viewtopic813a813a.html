				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Fri Feb 17, 2017 11:46 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Often installers ask for admin rights but they actually don't need them to install. <br>
Mostly, this happens because programs try to install themselves into the program files folder by default.<br>
<br>
Here's the compiled version of <strong>SboxieUtil</strong> and its features:<br>
<strong>SboxieUtil Features</strong><br>
<br>
1. Install programs without Administrator Rights (no UAC prompts, no SBIE2217 errors).<br>
   -Tested with Inno Setup and NSIS installers, but it should work with other installers/programs too.<br>
<br>
2. Clipboard access control for sandboxed programs (ReadWrite, Read, Write, Block, BlockAll).<br>
<br>
<strong>New Feature:</strong><br>
<br>
3. Start/Run restrictions for programs installed <strong>inside</strong> of a sandbox.<br>
<br>
Note: It will not show any error messages when a process start was blocked but you can view the debug output with Dbgview from microsoft. (Apply a filter named SboxieUtil)<br>
<br>
Each feature supports exceptions "ProcessExceptions=" "SandboxExceptions=", configurable via SboxieUtil.ini<br>
More features will be added later, please check the readme file for the full feature list and installation instructions.<br>

				<div class="content">Sorry Barb, I will pay more attention next time and post it in the right section.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some updates regarding inno setup installers, I wrote a dll that can be injected via sandboxie to be able to run inno setup installers without admin rights too. <br>
Not sure if I'm allowed to upload it here as attachment, but if there is interest then I'll find a place to upload it.<br>
<br>
If someone likes to build a dll on their own, you'll need to hook ShellExecute/ShellExecuteEx and look for the "runas" verb, replace it with "open".<br>
Additionally the installer will also call "CheckTokenMembership", you'll have to hook that too and return true.</div>

				<div class="content">I just uploaded a beta version with a newly added feature, follow the link in the first post and open the beta folder to find it.<br>
<br>
<strong>New Feature:</strong><br>
<br>
Start/Run restrictions for programs installed <strong>inside</strong> of a sandbox.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I know you're actually not supposed to install programs inside of a sandbox, but it can be useful in some cases so I ended up adding this feature.<br>
If you install a program normally (outside of a sandbox) then please stick to the Start/Run restrictions offered by sandboxie itself.<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: It will not show any error messages when a process start was blocked but you can view the debug output with Dbgview from microsoft. (Apply a filter named SboxieUtil)</div>

				<div class="content">Update: <br>
<br>
I simplified everything and replaced the registry tweaks with a new RunAsInvoker= key inside SboxieUtil.ini<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
@Barb (Or any other moderator):<br>
<br>
Could you modify the first post and remove all the lines starting from "Often installers ask ..." up to "Here's the compiled version..." ? <br>
Thanks</div>
