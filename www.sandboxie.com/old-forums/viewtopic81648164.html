				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I am trying to write a batch file to be put in Send To that when SBP has started Sandboxie, executes the program to be started via commandline, if sbp has not been started starts sandboxie and then after sb is up executes the program to be sandboxed.<br>
<br>
My difficulty is how do I check that sb is fully up and running when starting it via sbp.<br>
<br>
Could you help?<br>
<br>
Here is the batch:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>if exist "c:\Apps\SandboxiePortable\App\Sandboxie\Start.exe" goto verification
start "SBPortable" C:\Apps\SandboxiePortable\SandboxiePortable.exe
:Verification
if exist "c:\Apps\SandboxiePortable\App\Sandboxie\Start.exe" (
start "SB" c:\Apps\SandboxiePortable\App\Sandboxie\Start.exe %1
goto exit
) ELSE (
goto verification
)
pause
:exit
exit
</code></pre></div>

Regards,<br>
<br>
Samuel</div>

				<div class="content">OK thank you here is the finished batch to be put into SendTo folder for use with SBP:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>:: Use process viewer clu at http://www.teamcti.com/pview/prcview.htm  to check if SB is active
pv.exe SbieCtrl.exe &gt;nul
if ERRORLEVEL 1 goto sbpstart
if ERRORLEVEL 0 goto execute
:sbpstart
start "SBPortable" C:\Apps\SandboxiePortable\SandboxiePortable.exe
:: pv checks every 0.5sec and waits until process is active
 pv -r0 -d500 SbieCtrl.exe &gt;nul
:Execute
start "SB" c:\Apps\SandboxiePortable\App\Sandboxie\Start.exe /box:DefaultBox %1
goto exit
:exit
exit
</code></pre></div>

Best to make batch file execute minimized.</div>

Huh?  This is not a launcher for any other programs.  You need to find your own solution to that problem.</div>

<br>
Maybe I didn't make myself clear so let me ask the question in a different way: Sandboxie has a shortcut to launch a sandboxed (default) browser directly from C drive, how do I adapt that to a portable browser which resides on a USB?<br>
<br>
"C:\Program Files\Sandboxie\Start.exe" default_browser</div>

				<div class="content">Again, that's got nothing to do with this project really, but...<br>
<br>
You need your own script/shortcut/launcher that resides on your USB drive and can utilize relative paths so you can launch your browser -<br>
<br>
"..\..\rel\path\to\Start.exe" "..\..\rel\path\to\browser.exe"</div>

				<h3>licensing Q</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Mon Mar 29, 2010 11:30 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Hello everyone, and good work wraithdu! <br>
<br>
I was wondering about using this, but have trouble understanding the licensing issues. <br>
If i take it to work, what kind of license do i need? What if i take it to a friends PC? Does it matter if it's work related or not?<br>
I'm guessing a personal license doesn't cut it somehow, as it is tied to HW that i personally own, even if the USB is mine. SBIE does get temporarily installed on the PC, and even if it magically didn't, its resources would be used.<br>
I've almost made the decision to buy a license and contribute to Tzuk, just want to clear this. Been a fan for years!<br>
<br>
So, what kind of license do i need? My boss acquiring one is out of the question, this is basically for personal use, indirectly related to work (when i actually use/need it at work). <br>
<br>
 <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>
<br>
TIA any kind soul, or Tzuk!</div>

				<div class="content">These are questions for tzuk.  My launcher has an open license.  But Sandboxie can only be registered with your license key on hardware you own.  Even after uninstallation / closing the portable version, the license information remains in the registry forever.  However you can use Sandboxie in its free unregistered form wherever you wish.</div>

So i could use the unregistered version? Curious. It doesn't make much sense to me a priori, but Tzuk must have some reasoning.<br>
Why does the license info stay? Not that it makes much difference note, but..<br>
<br>
BTW thanks for the reply!</div>
