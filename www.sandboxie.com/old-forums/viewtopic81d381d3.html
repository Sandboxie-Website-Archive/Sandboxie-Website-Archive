				<div class="content">Hi i love your work on sandboxie but i was wondering is it possible for a program to recover or undelete the files deleted when clearing the sandbox? Such as when you delete files from a computer it can still be recovered or that it is still sotred. If it is possible to recover the files then would spyware also be able to stay on your system? I guess to get to the point are the files deleted absolutely securely deleted?</div>

The short answer is YES.<br>
<br>
You are asking if a deleted spyware program can recover its own deleted program.  The answer is no because, by the time you clean sandbox, the spyware program has been terminated and deleted.  It has ceased to exist in your computer.  It is simply not there anymore, so it cannot ask the computer to recover its own files.</div>
