				<h3>How to run a Compatibility Mode inside Sandboxie?</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi! I've been trying to figure out on how to run some executables within the Sandboxie using the "<strong>Compatibility</strong>" mode to Windows XP.<br>
<br>
Whenever I right-clicked an exe via "<strong>Program Compatibility Troubleshooter"</strong>, the system would tell me this:<br>
<br>
"<span style="text-decoration: underline">An error occurred while troubleshooting: A problem is preventing the trouble shooter from starting</span>."<br>
<br>
<br>
And so, I tried the compatibility changes under <strong>"Properties</strong>", I was able to change it to Windows XP and "<strong>Run as Admin</strong>"<br>
However, if a program is ran under "<strong>Program Compatibility Troubleshooter</strong>", it would work.<br>
But if I tried the above method under "<strong>Properties</strong>", it wouldn't run. Am I missing something here? Do I need to change something in the system to make my apps to work?<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance!</div>

<br>
Please provide the required information so that we can assist you:<br>

<br>
I am guessing you are clicking on "Run compatibility troubleshooter". Not all Windows features will run inside an isolated environment.<br>
<br>
Have you tried changing the compatibility mode outside Sandboxie, then running the program Sandboxed? <br>
Or, open Explorer Sandboxed (Right-click on your Sandbox --&gt; Run Windows Explorer), then navigate to the location of your program, right-click properties, Compatibility tab, make manual changes and re-try. <br>
<br>

				<div class="content">Hi <strong></strong>again, and thanks for the reply! ^^<br>
<br>
Here's some of my details:<br>
<br>
<strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 Pro<br>
<strong>SB</strong>: v.5.23.3 64bit<br>
<strong>AV</strong>: Windows Defender<br>
<br>
I did try that running a <strong>compatibility troubleshooter</strong> outside of <strong>Sandboxie</strong>, but it's asking me to run it if it's working, I'm worried it would run in a <strong>free-environment</strong> in doing so, is there any workaround outside of <strong>Sandboxie</strong> like inputting a prefix/suffix command on a target executable so it would run?<br>
<br>
I also tried manually editing it within <strong>Sandboxie</strong>, by going through <strong>Properties</strong> and to <strong>Compatibility</strong>, the system did say it was changed, but it's not working as it's intended to be, it would seem like manually changing an executable's <strong>compatibility</strong> within <strong>Sandboxie</strong> would never trigger any changes at all, unless I've changed it in <strong>free-environment</strong>.<br>
<br>
<br>
Or is there some sort of features in <strong>Sandboxie</strong> to make any program within to run in <strong>WinXP</strong> mode?</div>

<br>
If you  provide the program that you are trying to run in compatibility mode, and what settings are you trying to apply, I will test it.<br>
<br>
You can change the compatibility settings outside Sandboxie without having to launch the program (No need to use the troubleshooter):<br>
Right-click on your program ---&gt; Properties---&gt; Compatibility tab---&gt; make the desired changes (may need to make them for all users), apply the changes. Try launching the app Sandboxed.<br>
