				<h3>A drunken dance with BlockPort</h3>

				<div class="content">Where to start? I'm weird, there we go! I like to use SBIE options as redundancies where possible including as an anti-exe inside with Start Run Access etc. Among these are BlockPort rules which are redundant due to firewall rules.<br>
<br>
Well I had gotten most of my boxes working well without problems but one particular game just would not go online or connect and was about as jerky as me in a fps after 12 beers even in single player...<br>
<br>
I'm actually already using a similar setup in all my other boxes including Steam and this was the only thing that had any issues.<br>
<br>
As I normally just copy and paste the port list (then remove the spaces) from my firewall rules I was confused as to why BlockPort was causing this. I couldn't find anything to help me via Resource Access Monitor or SBIE Trace so I finally started my own little test routine.<br>
<br>
As it turns out these 'outbound' packets that my BlockPort rules were preventing was to myself at 127.0.0.1 and the windows firewall doesn't block these localhost connections so I had no existing rule referencing that port and had not allowed it on my BlockPort=*,# list.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now at least I know for the future, <span style="text-decoration: underline">check localhost connections if using BlockPort shows different results</span>!<br>
Figured I'd share my experience here in case I forget and run into the same issue again down the line or it helps anyone else using BlockPort rules.</div>
