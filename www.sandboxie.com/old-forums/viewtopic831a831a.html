				<h3>Moving the Sandbox folder on another drive or partition</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sun Jun 28, 2009 4:52 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>J. L.</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Currently, my downloads are saved in a folder on another larger partition, but SandBoxie's sandbox folder is on my system partition. I download large files (videos mainly) that requires a lot of time to move from one partition to the next when recovering.<br>
Also, my hard drive is quite old, and isn't at the best of health, so I would like having it not do such work frequently.<br>
Is there a way for me to move that folder and make Sandboxie use it?<br>
All help will be appreciated.</div>

				<div class="content">You have a couple of choices. You can change the "container folder" to another drive.<br>
From Sandbox &gt; Set container folder<br>
Read the note at the bottom of the window that opens, since you will no longer be using the original C:\Sandbox\(user)\ folder.<br>
<br>
You could also put a sandbox folder on a different drive, and keep the one(s) you already have on C:.<br>
All that is needed is to make a manual edit to your Sandboxie configuration.<br>
<br>
I have a sandbox on K: drive, which happens to be a TrueCrypt volume.<br>
I didn't use the (user) variable for that sandbox, so it's at  K:\Sandbox<br>
On the drive you want to use for the new sandbox, create a "Sandbox" folder in the root directory.<br>
For me, that is K:\Sandbox<br>
<br>
Use Sandboxie's Sandbox &gt; Create New Sandbox<br>
then give that sandbox a name<br>
(I'll use TrueCrypt, but you use a name of your choice)<br>
Use Configure &gt; Edit Configuration and find the heading for the new sandbox, after it's created.<br>
Insert a new line after the heading, like this:<br>
<br>
[<span style="color: red">TrueCrypt</span>]<br>
FileRootPath=<span style="color: green"><strong>K</strong></span>:\Sandbox\%SANDBOX%<br>
<br>
Your sandbox name will already be in the brackets where I have <span style="color: red">TrueCrypt</span><br>
Just put your own drive letter in place of <strong><span style="color: green">K</span></strong>, and the rest of the line stays as-is.</div>
