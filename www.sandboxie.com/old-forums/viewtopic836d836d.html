				<div class="content">You need to hide the files inside your current profile. Go to Sandbox settings&gt;Resource access&gt;File access&gt;Write Only access, Click Add program, add chrome.exe. Click Add, navigate to your current Chrome profile and select it. That makes the Profile folder look empty to the installer so it creates new files in the sandbox.<br>

				<div class="content">Thank you bo.elam for your procedure, it's now working!  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
After i installed chrome, the browser opened automatically but i noticed that i can't find chrome.exe in the sandbox...Weird!<br>
<br>
 i watched all the folders in it and i found no chrome.exe so i can't re-open the browser!  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> <br>
<br>
Drives + C + Program Files (86) + application and the only thing in that folder is dbug.log<br>
<br>
I took the chrome installer here: <a href="https://archive.org/details/49.0.2623.112ChromeInstaller" class="postlink">https://archive.org/details/49.0.2623.1 ... eInstaller</a></div>

				<div class="content">Palemoon, you need to create a sandboxed shortcut to run Chrome that you installed in the sandbox.<br>
<br>
I dont use Chrome, have never installed it in my system, so I am not familar with it but I ll tell you what works for Firefox. I am pretty sure it should work the same with Chrome.<br>
<br>
Create the shortcut using one of this two procedures:<br>
<br>
1. Open Sandboxie control&gt;Configure&gt;Windows shell integration, Click Add shortcut icons, select the sandbox where you installed Chrome, Click OK, that opens Sandboxies Start Menu. Find Chrome in one of the menus and click it. That click places the sandboxed shortcut at your Desktop. For example, if when you installed Chrome in the sandbox you ticked the option to place a shortcut at the Desktop then you ll find the shortcut at the Destop menu in Sandboxies Start Menu.<br>
<br>
2. Using a non sandboxed Windows explorer/File explorer go into C&gt;Sandbox&gt;User, in the folder of the sandbox where you installed Chrome find the Chrome installation. If you installed it to Drives + C + Program Files (86), then look for that folder inside C&gt;Sandbox&gt;User&gt;the sandbox where chrome is installed, find chrome.exe, and make a shortcut. You can do it by right clicking chrome.exe and selecting Send to&gt;Desktop.<br>
<br>
Either way should work for creating a sandboxed shortcut.<br>
<br>
Or, to avoid using a shortcut, you can run Chrome by using Sandboxies Start Menu (Right click Sandboxies icon by the clock&gt;Hover the browser over the sandbox you installed Chrome&gt;Click Run from Start Menu&gt;Find Chrome in one of the menus, like Desktop and click it). That runs Chrome that you installed sandboxed.<br>

				<div class="content">Thank's bo.elam but i know how to create a short cut!<br>
<br>
 For some reason chrome.exe was not available in the sandbox (weird stuff...lol) But i discovered the original ChromeSetup.exe downloader installer for the version i want to test and all the files that is suppose to be on the sandbox are all there now like chrome.exe! <br>
<br>
So now i can use a fresh browser without add-ons and bookmarks!<br>
<br>
Thank's again!<br>
<br>
Problem solved!  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>
