+1 People use it because of free upgrade (time to upgrade is one year) and for D3D12... but we have only one d3d12 benchmark for now</div>

This is an old problem I've seen since Windows 7, Sandboxie 4.12, and FF 31 (August 2014). I posted the problem here (<a href="viewtopicac13ac13.php?f=11&amp;t=19414" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 11&amp;t=19414</a> ), never got any replies. I think I made a bug report, never got any replies there either. The problem exists to this day despite the changes to FF and Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
It happens with Chrome and Lastpass in Sandboxie as well. Since Lastpass is essential for managing my logins, it really puts a big crimp in using Sandboxie while browsing.</div>

Yeah, I should have said I tried it with both of those as well as every update to Sandboxie or FF since I reported the problem.<br>
<br>
It's the same bad result.</div>

Is there any kind of logging I can turn on that would help me debug this? When it crashes, I get the error message "SBIE2203 Failed to communicate with Sandboxie Service:  null reply (msg 00001B81 len 2457974)". It very definitely happens when I enable the Lastpass extension and everything works find when I disable the Lastpass extension (I do have other extensions loaded).</div>
