I've found a temporary solution to the "Sandboxie doesn't work if Comodo Firewall/Antivirus is installed on Windows 10" problem.<br>
<br>
First make sure you have the latest version of Sandboxie installed. I've tested using Sandboxie V 5.01.13<br>
<br>
Open Comodo and click Open Advanced Settings.<br>
<br>
Go to Defence+ / HIPS / HIPS Settings. You will see a setting called "Detect shellcode injections". <strong>Make sure it's checked because the solution doesn't work if it's disabled.</strong> (You don't need to have HIPS enabled if you don't want to, just make sure "Detect shellcode injections" is checked).<br>
<br>
Now click on Exclusions. In the window that opens right click and choose Add -&gt; Files.<br>
<br>
Go to the Sandboxie folder located in Program Files or Program Files (x86) and select all the executables you find there<br>
<br>
"Start.exe""License.exe""SandboxieBITS.exe""SandboxieCrypto.exe""SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe""SandboxieRpcSs.exe""SandboxieWUAU.exe""SbieCtrl.exe""SbieIni.exe""SbieSvc.exe"<br>
<br>
Click OK to add them, then click OK in all Comodo windows that are opened.<br>
<br>
Now Sandboxie works  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green">  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green">  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> <br>
<br>
One more thing. I've discovered all this by accident. After the latest update Chrome would crash on start (Google Chrome has stopped working) if Comodo was installed. The solution I've found was to add C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe to the same Exclusions list in Comodo. This had nothing to do with Sandboxie, but it gave me the idea to try and do the same thing with Sandboxie's executables.</div></blockquote>

Confirmed. This does work.</div>

I read somewhere that right now there is a known issue between Comodo and Chrome. <br>

Thanks a lot for sharing that !  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
I was visiting this topic from time to time to see if there were any progress.<br>
It was very frustrating not being allowed to use both programs.</div>

				<div class="content">It's possible an update to those programs (or the MS Update on the 8th) changed the way they interact with SBIE. The explorer.exe error has been fixed, I would recommend disabling Comodo (also make sure you've followed the compatibility steps above) as well as Avira.<br>
Usually, the #1 conflict is AV programs. They're updated a lot, and well....they don't play nice.</div>

I know with KIS Pure 3 Works fine with Sandboxie but I had upgraded to KIS2016 just last week so never new of problem.<br>
Guess I will again have to revert back to Pure 3 unless somehow a fix is found or created.<br>
<br>

				<div class="content">Hey Guys,<br>
<br>
Well I have been talking to Kasperky and as other said they are aware of the issue and are working on finding a fix.<br>
They had me run one of their tools to get all system info so they can try to fix the issue.<br>
<br>
They gave me the bug ID1183380 and they said they really are trying to fix this.<br>
I even told them I will fall back to old version of Kasperky as it will work under Pure 3.<br>
I told them if they can't find a fix then I will have no choice to switch to other companies virus protection.<br>
Not that one person matters to them but I am sure I am not the only one complaining to them.<br>
<br>
Anyways I just thought I would post to let people know.<br>
Thanks<br>
