				<h3>SbieSvc Cleanup</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Thu Aug 17, 2017 10:57 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Syrinx</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Related to the <a href="viewtopicd26bd26b.html?f=17&amp;t=23933" class="postlink">Lingering SbieSvc</a> thread I had going.<br>
<br>
Might it be possible for SbieCtrl or some other component to check for a related SbieSvc.exe (eg by boxname) in the wait state and send a terminate command when the related box is empty or in the closing/deleting phase?<br>
<br>
These lingering instances have the same username as that which the program was launched with. As such I don't guess there should be many potential permission issues. This would allow the behavior to remain the same, so that such processes aren't being created and killed constantly, but also allow Sandboxie to cleanup after itself in this scenario as it normally does in others.<br>
<br>
Update: Thought about this a bit more and realized I could sortof do this myself already. While it'd be nice for sandboxie to do the check itself to properly clean up...I created some small .bat files and added them under DeleteCommand= for the trouble boxes. I can finally have a clean system with no lingering SbieSvcs or needing to manually check for and kill them.<br>
<br>
Example:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>rmdir %1 /q /s
wmic process where "commandline like '%%_DefaultBox_%%'" call terminate</code></pre></div></div>

				<div class="content">Was hoping to edit but it has timed out. I decided on a slightly more detailed one instead just as a precaution:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>rmdir %1 /q /s
wmic process where "commandline like '%%Sandboxie_ComProxy_%%_DefaultBox_%%'" call terminate</code></pre></div>

P.S: Is there a DenialOfService attack under way or something? I keep getting an sql error (Too many connections [1040]) and even when it does load it is slow!</div>
