This is a rare issue. That has been almost completely addressed in the current RC (and through out many beta's previous.). <br>
<br>
What Windows version?<br>
<br>
How are you starting the program that triggers this error? Forced or not?<br>
Timing / race issue with programs loading...possibly.<br>
Did you try use version 5.07.7 previously?<br>
Memory allocation (888, 999) error may be present in the error usually. (something we're looking into, but you didn't mention that error having 888,999.<br>
<br>
<strong>Usually, restarting the program again (or making sure the program actually exited from SBIE) will resolve it. </strong><br>
<br>
It's very machine dependent at this point.</div>

Are you getting notification to access the print spooler? SBIE 1319? <br>
By default, SBIE blocks that. Because you have to go outside the sandbox to print.<br>
<a href="viewtopic266b266b.php?f=11&amp;t=21566&amp;p=111981&amp;hilit=print+spooler#p112086" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... er#p112086</a>   - this thread has info about Epson printers and FF, but would apply to Chrome.</div>

				<div class="content">I have noticed a MASSIVE memory leak with 5.08 and under. <br>
<br>
The last version working is 5.07.1 <br>
(I had 5.07.1 on my harddrive (since it was from my previous windows install), then I skipped to 5.07.8 so versions up to .8 might or might not have the bug.)<br>
<br>
if I play a video file in the sandbox 5.07.8+ I notice the Used Physical Memory going from 1.7 GB (normal) slowly increasing to 6+ GB then eventually the display driver crashes or system black screens / logs off a message pops up saying firefox is using to much memory and to close it (but firefox is not the problem) - I have 14GB of ram.<br>
<br>
event log. (this is shortly after a clean restart- and using sandboxie for approx 20 minutes (playing a video file) )<br>
Application popup: <br>
Windows - Out of Virtual Memory : Your system is low on virtual memory. To ensure that Windows runs properly, increase the size of your virtual memory paging file. For more information, see Help. <br>
<br>
Resource-Exhaustion-Detector<br>
"Windows successfully diagnosed a low virtual memory condition. The following programs consumed the most virtual memory: firefox.exe (1588) consumed 578609152 bytes, thunderbird.exe (6408) consumed 166752256 bytes, and explorer.exe (4212) consumed 71860224 bytes."<br>
<br>
This is a clean install of Windows 10 Professional x64 10586 (1511) - I first made sure it wasn't firefox (not opening it) and some other steps, ....etc.....etc I then downgraded sandboxie to 5.07.1 and I notice the Physical memory get instantly released when the driver unloaded so it was definitely sandboxie causing it. - now my system is stable again with 5.07.1 - Physical memory now says more or less the same increases / decreases like normal.<br>
<br>
I used winamp to play the video files and also using LAV Filters (codecs) -<br>
<br>
I assume a lot of other people are having the same error but unless they have computer experience it is very hard to track the issue down to sandboixe and windows blames other programs....<br>
Just a heads up, I am using the official sandboxie build from the home page or this forum, I am using the free version (1 sandbox) -<br>
<br>
I wish I could help more but unfortunately I need a stable and corrupt free computer.</div>

Ah yes, we are aware of this. And we know why this happens.....Are you a paid user of SBIE? You're using v5.08 I'm assuming? If so, can you please email your registration key to <a href="mailto:support@sandboxie.com">support@sandboxie.com</a> ?</strong></div>

				<div class="content">That's good news that you found the bug, now I'm looking forward to a fix!,<br>
 I usually don't do bug reports but since I like Sanboxie I was concerned you released a Stable build of 5.08 that could be effecting thousands of people that use SBIE to play videos.. <br>
obviously bugs are not as bad when it's just a Beta / Forum release but once it's a main release it could effect a lot of people and even companies .<br>
<br>
I am using the free version so I don't think there is a registration key if there is let me know where to find it and I will send it to you.<br>
(I have been using sanboxie since it came out and even before Invincea took it over so I am fairly familiar with it) <br>
<br>
The bug was in 5.08 but also 507-8, 5.07.7 - didn't test .6 or .5 .4 .3 .2 so I'm not 100% sure when it first appeared, this is a clean windows 10 x64 install, I believe it worked fine before the clean install I was using a older windows 10 though.<br>
The only change I did was remove a few MS programs like Cortana and most of the Metro APPS, and used O&amp;O Shut Up to disable the MS telemetry reporting..I disabled windows defender, and windows firewall - everything else is 100% <br>
Installed drivers , realtek audio, nvidia drivers, Intel RST, Renesas USB 3.0, Power Panel (UPS), Toshiba BT stack<br>
<br>
here is my sandbox.ini maybe this can help<br>

We know why it occurs and what triggers that very, very specific error you are reporting. <br>

Paid users and companies need not worry if they are using a authenticated, registered version of SBIE. <br>

				<div class="content">Great. Are you still using 5.08?<br>
<br>
If you are, and do get the leak, you can send us a Procmon file so we can analze any .crashes/leaks and look at the integrity of the SBIE program:<br>
<br>
You can use procmon and post the results to us. <br>
Get procmon here (free) <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processmonitor.aspx" class="postlink">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sys ... nitor.aspx</a><br>
<br>
Close any programs that are not needed.<br>
Run Procom (not sandboxed)<br>
and then try and fire up a program (or the browser causing issues) (sandboxed of course). <br>
Let the error happen/not load/etc/memory leak etc.<br>
stop capturing events in Procmon (under file) <br>
then Save the results (under file, make sure "save all events it ticked") and <br>
save in PML format. <br>
These files can be large, so post somewhere we can download and look (link)<br>
OR (Please zip them!) and send to <a href="mailto:Support@sandboxie.com">Support@sandboxie.com</a></div>

I think maybe it was due to an unstable system OC, I upped the ram voltage slightly to 1.52v maybe sandboxie is sensitive to ram OC - strange though since I ran memtest x86+ for 10 hours with no errors so it should of been stable :X</div>
