				<div class="content">Hello Forum<br>
re:Licenses issued in the past which did not include an expiration date will remain without expiration date, and may be used on more than one computer, per past licensing terms.<br>
<br>
I have a license without an expiration date.  AKA  No expiration date / May be used on more than one computer<br>
Anyway, when I clic Help &gt; Register Sandboxie<br>
I see &gt; The license for Sandboxie will have to be reactivated in 110 days<br>
I see &gt; Your Product Key does not have an expiration date<br>
<br>
 So, what happens in 110 days and how do I use (install) on more than one computer.<br>
About Sandboxie &gt; Sandboxie is registered and the license is activated.<br>
v4.12<br>
Thank you in advance</div>

				<div class="content">bjm, what you see in Help &gt; Register Sandboxie and About Sandboxie is what you are supposed to see. Next time you upgrade Sandboxie, you can let SBIE reactivate the license automatically or you can click Reactivate.<br>
<br>
To use the license in other computers, they have to be yours, all you have to do is insert the license key and click OK.<br>

So, Sandboxie will recognize my lifetime / more than one computer key.<br>
If there is no upgrade before 109 days counting down.  Do I have to Reactivate under the lifetime license key.<br>
I'm afraid I'll get switched to the current one year / one computer key policy if I Reactivate</div>

				<div class="content">Hi bjm. Let me put it to you this way. I don't remember last time that I clicked Reactivate. Sandboxie reactivates the license on its own. As of this moment, in About Sandboxie, you see Sandboxie is registered and the license is activated, you dont need to click reactivate. Don't worry about nothing. All the information that you said that you see in About Sandboxie and under Register Sandboxie is word by word exactly what I see in the two computers that I OWN in which I am using my license.<br>
<br>
If you have a lifetime license purchased long ago, you can use it on any computer that you personally own. If thats the type of license that you have, then you can use it on a second computer. Otherwise, I suggest not to do it.<br>

I took this statement &lt;&lt; The license for Sandboxie <strong><span style="color: #FF0000">will have to be reactivated </span></strong>in 110 days &gt;&gt; literally.<br>
Thanks Bo</div>
