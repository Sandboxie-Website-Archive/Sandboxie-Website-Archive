				<h3>Question about &quot;LIFETIME LICENSE&quot; with multiple pe</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello. I have been using Sandboxie for some time now on 4 PCs. I don't run anything in a sandbox that often, I just have Sandboxie installed if I need it. I'm thinking of buying a lifetime license but I'm wanting to know if I need four licenses or if one will do. I have my desktop (main gaming PC), a media PC (on all the time), a tablet (for IT house calls) and a gaming laptop. I know Sandboxie runs in the background if the machine is on but I only use it for the machine I'm currently working on if needed.<br>
<br>
I just want to know if one license will work for all my PCs without causing a licence issue. Also, can you disable Sandboxie from starting at logon and then start it if I need it? I have an AnyDVD lifetime licence and its installed on 3 PCs. I just disable it from auto starting with Windows so I don't get a licence error. Slysoft said it was ok since its not running at the same time. Could I do something like that but with Sandboxie?</div>

				<div class="content">If you buy a personal lifetime license you can install and use Sandboxie on all computers that you own. In short: yes, you only need to buy one license.</div>

				<div class="content">You don't need to disable Sandboxie from starting with Windows but if you want to do so, you can in Sandboxie control&gt;Windows shell integration, untick "When Windows start". Sandboxie allows you to have one or more of your computers running at the same time,  doing that does not cause License problems or errors. <br>

How do you determine when you'll need it?<br>
My criterion for needing Sandboxie is whenever I am connected to the internet.   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>

				<div class="content">This is great new. As far as "when I need it", I use it to test new apps so I don't have to track down all the changes it made. It works with most installer as long as it they don't install a driver or something similar. I many use it for testing mods for Skyrim. I run Nexus Mod Manager in a sand box and install or remove mods then launch Skyrim from the manager. Since the manager and Skyrim are in the same sandbox, all changes are temporarily.<br>

<br>
Buying a licence now. Thanks again for the answer to my question. Thanks to developers of Sandboxie for making it, this is a must for every Win OS!</div>

What you would like to have <strong>is no longer available</strong> since a couple of days because licensing terms have changed on October 9th!<br>
