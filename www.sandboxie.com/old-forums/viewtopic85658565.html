				<div class="content">Since Tor crashes with SBIE (Sandboxie) and is officially not supported and hence <br>
listed under Known Conflict Section list of this forum. Can someone recommend a free <br>
alternative sandboxie program for Tor. Thank you in advance.</div>

It works very quickly for me without any crashes. Does that mean Sandboxie is not really protecting TOR but only gives impression (I can see it in the Sandboxie Control as well the [#] indicators)?</div>

Um, no. Those are just GUI indicators. Like the SBIE tray icon, etc. Chrome doesn't do it, neither does FF. So, If you run TOR in SBIE, you assume because it may work, SBIE simply isn't working?? that's non sense. That's not how software works.<br>
<br>
SBIE has a built in tool. "is this window sandboxed" in SBIE Control. Run that, is the program running in SBIE control? Then fine.<br>
<br>
Tor is known conflict for many reasons. 1. It's known to crash for no reason in SBIE or become slow. 2. We won't troubleshoot this type of browser.<br>
<br>
So, YMMV. But if we have a program as a known conflict, it either doesn't work, works slowly, or simply is incompatible.<br>
<br>
SBIE doesn't do half measure. That's impossible from a software point of view.</div>

It does feel like you do when you choose to ignore TBB. I understand it might be difficult to make it work but I really doubt anything is impossible. <br>
<br>
In my opinion Tor should be a high priority for you guys. It is targeted by many organisations and governments with a lot of resources. A lot of people who uses Tor needs very high security.</div>

				<div class="content">May not be an acceptable alternative, but you could just use Sandboxie and a VM and the VM could be your sandbox.   Since it takes seconds to recover from a golden set point, it's at least a viable solution to address TOR compatibility issues.    <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

I considered that, I will look into that further. Thanks<br>
<br>
Anyone else using tor with a sandboxed alternative? I would like to hear of your setup alternatives.</div>
