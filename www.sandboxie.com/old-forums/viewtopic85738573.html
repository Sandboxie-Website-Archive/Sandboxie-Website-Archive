				<div class="content">Across several sandboxes I lost data. The strange part is, it was selective.<br>
<br>
For example, files sitting on the desktop of said sandboxes are all gone. Yet, the sandboxed browsers I have built have largely retained their settings, history, and bookmarks.<br>
<br>
One sandboxed browser I had configured kept full history and bookmarks, but lost the two most recent addons I installed (several weeks ago). Another sandboxed browser lost the visual theme I began using a few weeks ago, but retained other configuration settings I just recently made yesterday.<br>
<br>
I'm totally clueless on this one. The said data seems to be totally gone, but the nature of this incident is just baffling to me.</div>

<br>
Please provide the required info so that we can test the scenario:<br>
<a href="viewtopic633b633b.html?f=11&amp;t=19746" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=19746</a><br>
<br>
Any chance that you are using CCleaner or a similar program which might be targeting locations in which your Sandboxes reside? <br>
Are your sandboxes set to auto-delete? <br>
<br>
If you are using web-browser templates, that would explain why certain things (history, bookmarks, etc) did not get deleted as they are passed to your host (not sure what is your configuration, please post a copy of it by going to Configure --&gt; Edit configuration.  Paste the output here, highlight it and click on the "&lt;/&gt;"  button to format it in the forum).<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not using templates, so the retained information did not come from the host. Totally bizarre in my experience. Anyway, I was just looking for some common-sense thoughts on what might have happened if anyone wants to shoot out some ideas.</div>

If you provide the info I requested on my previous response, we can go from there.<br>
Without further details we can't properly assist you. <br>
