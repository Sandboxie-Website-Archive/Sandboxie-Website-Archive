Most of us discovered Sandboxie by luck or while looking for something that worked differently than traditional signature security programs. Thats what I was doing when I discovered SBIE, I remember, a bunch of other programs came in front of my face for the first time at the same time as SBIE, most of this programs claimed to be the best against malware but not SBIE. <br>
<br>
To me, Sandboxie was the quiet one but there was something about it that got to me, I think it was by instincts that I decided to try Sandboxie. The decision to use Sandboxie and eventually purchase a license are without doubt the wisest decisions that I done regarding the security of my computers. Like you, Mr X, I believe spending a few dollars for my license is the best money that I have ever spend on line. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"> <br>

				<div class="content">I very rarely buy programs, I try to run as much (good) freeware and open source software as possible. I had my old computer infectred and crashed and I've lost all my data in 2008. From then on I went on a quest for better protection than just a conventional Anti-Virus, I did an extensive reserach, almost decided on the DefenseWall and then tried Sandboxie which I liked more (and especially later as it was able to run on 64-bit systems). It is my favourite program and it's definetely money very well spent (on the lifetime license back in the day).

This is old link where you could buy lifetime license. Not sure if you still can. The question is on how many PC you own this license can be simultaneously used?</div></blockquote>

janbee, I think there is no need for you to worry. <br>
<br>
In your posting above (<a href="viewtopic96f7-296f7.html?p=105464#p105464" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 64#p105464</a>) you wrote that you bought (and paid) a Lifetime License for 35,72 Euro and you showed that this is verified by a message from Cleverbridge. So obviously this was a correct deal, which means that you have and will keep in the future a valid Liftetime Licencse.<br>
<br>
Of course a company can change its pricing and/or licensing policy but this will (only) affect future deals/customers and cannot influence the conditions of the transactions which were already closed before.<br>
<br>
That's the way I see it.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>

Thats awesome news Curt, thanks for confirming! I did facepalm a little at the news though, I bought a years subscription for the first time only yesterday.. dohh. Saying that if it helps keeps this awesome program in development I'm not complaining about having to pay an extra £15.<br>
<br>
Cheers.</div>
