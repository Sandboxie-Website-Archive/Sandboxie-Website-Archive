				<div class="content">I just started using Sandboxie, but I'm having issues.  I run a suspicious installation program inside the sandbox, everything checks out fine, then I want to install it outside the sandbox.  <br>
<br>
I tried both just using the function to delete sandbox files (per the faq, this will uninstall anything), as well as running ccleaner in the sandbox to uninstall.  In both cases, trying to install outside the sandbox fails (depending upon the installation, the error may be different, but none of them give a detailed reason for the failure).  Trying to install again inside the sandbox it works fine.<br>
<br>
What am I doing wrong?</div>

<br>
What are your OS, Antivirus and Sandboxie versions?<br>
What application are you trying to install?<br>
What is the exact error message that you are receiving? <br>
<br>
Installing inside the Sandbox should not affect your host. <br>
If needed, you can completely delete/review the contents of the Sandbox via ---&gt; C:\Sandbox\Username\Sandboxname using Windows Explorer (outside Sandboxie).<br>

You can use Sandboxie for testing programs, and keep the installation for a while, that usually works out great. But using Sandboxie for telling if a suspicious program is malicious or not is not a good idea. Some malware can tell when they are in the sandbox and wont do nothing harmful to fool you into running it outside the sandbox. <br>
<br>
To get rid of sandboxed installations, deleting contents is all you need to do. No need to run CCleaner.<br>

Thank you for the response.  <br>
<br>
Win10 Pro, Avast, 5.18 64bit<br>
<br>
Any application I install within the sandbox seems to have an issue when trying to install outside the sandbox.  An old version of SnagIt, in particular, was what I was getting frustrated with when I posted this.  I should probably note that while running installations, Sandboxie pops up errors that it was trying to use this-or-that from the system.  I just skip the errors, and everything seems to work.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry I can't recall the exact error messages when I install outside the sandbox.  It was always something generic about the installation not being able to continue.<br>
<br>
Of course, now that I try it again, the SnagIt installation works just fine.  Though, this time, I didn't run it sandboxed first.<br>
<br>

By suspect, I'm all encompassing: something from an untrusted source like a random freeware site, to likely malicious file from a clearly disreputable site, to a program that might just add too much junk and integration for my tastes.<br>
<br>
It's not foolproof for sure, and I shouldn't ever get too comfortable, but testing in a sandbox is always worth it.</div>

Unless you have explicitly opened paths, your Sandboxed applications should not be able to modify your host.<br>
Without further details, I cannot test the behavior. If you encounter the issue again (as it seems from your last response, you are no longer able to reproduce it), please provide repro steps, as well as the full error message(s),  and I will have a look.<br>

<br>
To delete programs installed inside Sandboxie, right-click on the Sandbox ---&gt; "Delete contents". <br>
To manually delete your Sandboxes, go to C:\Sandbox\YourUserName   (this is the default location, if you changed it in the past, it may be located elsewhere). Delete the desired folders.<br>
<br>
If your browsers are still opening Sandboxed you may have set them as Forced Programs. Please see this entry so that you can check your Sandbox:<br>
<a href="../ProgramStartSettings.html#program" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/ProgramStartSettings#program</a><br>
<br>
The same applies to folders, please see this entry:<br>
<a href="../ForceFolder.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/ForceFolder</a><br>

				<div class="content">I assume that you know to install programs inside of a sandbox by...<br>
1) Create a sandbox to use for the program (Sandbox &gt; Create New Sandbox).<br>
2) Right-click the program's installer file, and then click on "Run Sandboxed".<br>
Choose the sandbox which will contain the program, from the list.</div>
