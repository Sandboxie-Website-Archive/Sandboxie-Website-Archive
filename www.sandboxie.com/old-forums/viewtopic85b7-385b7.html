				<div class="content">I used Sandboxie for several years now, I don't remember when I started to use it. So far there where only the free version on my system. But there are some features you can only use with a bought License. I would like to use them but not to pay every year for it. There was a time where you could buy a lifetime license but I could not afford the way of payment at this time. Now I can but there is no lifetime license any more. I'm very sad about it.<br>
<br>
Please add a again a lifetime License option. The old type of it would be best (69€ (? if i remember right) for the use of any computer your own, including updates).  But I know you want to get some money for your work. I'm fine with some constraints and willing to pay more for it. How about a more expensive lifetime License for one computer at the same time (it should still work if I buy a new PC) with a limited kind of updates (only those which solving bugs and compatibility, no new features) . I'm willing to pay up to 100€ for this. I refuse to pay for a limited time period, no matter how cheap it is.<br>

SandboxieUser42, I would love to see the lifetime license make a comeback. And basically with the same terms as it was for a long time. Recommending people to purchase a license would be a lot easier if the lifetime license was available..<br>

If 29 euros would be just for one PC without time limit it would be too expensive imho. <strong>Do you know any advanced user who owns only one computer?</strong> I don't.<br>
Subscription like pay for one year license and use it on any computer you own would suck as all other subscription. I personally will never buy program using subscription license.<br>
Versions and updates. If you pay for a license you bought rights to use the program on conditions you have chosen. <strong>You paid for a license for an application so you have rights to update it.</strong> Not only from version number like from 1.00 to 1.01 but also for new branches like 2.00 or year releases like 2014/2015. <strong>If the license doesn't allow you to update application then it's not worth your money.</strong><br>
If more expensive and more restrictive license conditions then less people will buy it. Cheaper license and less restrictive conditions then more people will buy it.<br>
If I remember well there was 50% discount every Christmas, right?<br>
<br>
New sandboxie devs were complaining about some <strong>lifetime licenses</strong> with thousands of activations. Where is the problem? <strong>If you limit simultaneous installations to 10 computers it should be ok.</strong><br>
Example: If you have 5 PCs at home and you buy new one and get rid of old one you just deactivate license  on your account (via website) for old PC and then you have ability to use the license on new PC. As simply as that. If your netbook will burn down or got steal you don't loose rights to the license.</div>

The problem is the devs don't live in Poland. They have also higher cost in their regions. I'm sad about different salaries in different countries. It's hard to find a fair way.<br>
There could be different prices for different countries but there might be some people who exploit this.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Dun wrote:</cite> <strong>Do you know any advanced user who owns only one computer?</strong> I don't.

I know neither but you could buy a license for each of them. In addition the free version is also powerful and could be enough for most of you computers.
<blockquote><div><cite>Dun wrote:</cite> <strong>If the license doesn't allow you to update application then it's not worth your money.</strong> 
</div></blockquote>
Yeah, I would also be happy about that but at other side the producer has cost for supporting and developing his application. It's the same like at any other stuff you can buy. E.g. your car also getting old and need some repairs. After some time of guarantee you need to pay by yourself. You don't get any new car for free. It would be a nice world but we don't live there now. <br>
But I'm at the same opinion for critical updates (resolving bugs, compatibility).<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Dun wrote:</cite> <br>

</div></blockquote>
Thats true too but usually the producer want to maximize his profit and not the the number of persons who use it.<br>
<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Dun wrote:</cite> <br>

There are always some people who don't want to pay for the software they use. They often choose the most easiest way to do it. In the past they shared licenses from bought versions and you know about it. Now I'm sure they use some other way to get the software for free and you have less knowledge about the number of people doing this. Making a less attractive offer to people who want to pay for it is not the right way to solve the problem.<br>

I don't get your example. You should choose you mobile contract depending one your phone usage. They should change their type of contract if they talk/surf the whole day with their mobile phones. I use one of my mobile phones 10 days a year for less than 5 min each. I'm not willing to pay  every month a fixed  amount for it. So I picked the solution of paying in short time periods instead of long (in minutes not months). In addition you are doing the same thing like them with sandboxie. You prepay every year 15€ and use it for one year. I'm pretty sure in 10 years I still will using Sandboxie, so I am looking for contract with a longer time period because 150€ would be to much. An option with 20 years usage might be OK too but these time period is pretty uncommon so lifetime fits best here. You are argue against your own opinion. Or you just want to say you should not care about paying 15€ every year because a common people spend more money at senseless stuff every month?</div>

I disagree, totally. There is no excuse, no rhetorical speech, no arguments... anything to say Sandboxie is expensive or its price "too much" for a year.  At 15€ for <strong>1 year</strong> for preventing months maybe years of visits to the repair shop or formatting your HDD or losing your data or get your credentials robbed, it's a bargain.<br>
This people (Invincea's developers &amp; team) deserve to be well paid, well rewarded for they efforts and perhaps personal sacrifices. Hopefully Invincea never listen to this requests. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"><br>

This kind of gratefulness and well being due to Sandboxie are way worth than 15€ for <strong>1 year</strong><br>
<br>
A clumsy comparative just for have a new perspective:<br>
The average global price of a McDonald's meal is $6.61 USD. With the money needed to buy four meals for four persons a 1 year license is paid!!!! And those four meals only are the first of three meals per day!!!! <br>

I don't want them to earn less money. I just want longer time periods. For example as tverweij's idea for 4 years. You can compute how many people who bought Sandboxie for one year continue up to 4 years. Say 20% up to 4, 5% up to 3, 10% up to 2, 65% not. So they earn 27€ per user in 4 years. You need to factor in some more computation because of inflation, other consumer behaviour and so on. So say 29€ for 4 years. So because I'm sure I will using sandboxie in future I am interested in a longer contract to pay 29€ instead of 60€. If they did their computation right they would earn the same amount of money with this offering. So nothing would change for the Owner of Sandoxie. It will only be more friendly to people who in love with Sandboxie.<br>

That's not an example to compare with. The part of consumed resources is much higher at hamburgers than at Sandboxie. You pay for the written code that will not vanish and is easy to copy. The consumed resources are the work for updates, webpage and some more . You could use the software for infinite time without them. After one year of usage the largest part of the code is still the same. It's not fair to pay the same amount of money for something you already own mostly. So if you want annual payment there should be initial one and a smaller yearly (for updates). <br>
And how long would you pay 15€ a day to get 4 hamburgers each day? Wouldn't be 25€ for 2 times a week 4 hamburgers more attractive?<br>
<br>
Currently Sandboxie has only a offer for new friends not for the good old one's.</div>

				<div class="content">Currently the price is too high.  I like sandboxie, and I use it here and there, not every day, probably not even once a week. Even for a perpetual licence, 29 euro is just too much.<br>
<br>
If the devs decided to drop the price to something around the 10-15USD mark, for multiple simultaneous computer (e.g. up to 3), for a perpetual licence then I'd gladly pay that. <br>
After briefly reading this forum, I see there has to be numerous people that are willing to pay a fairer price, and the devs would then convert a lot of non-paying free users into paying users. I'm pretty sure that paying customers is better than the alternative. Perhaps the devs should consider approaching steam, since there are plenty of apps making their way there now.<br>
<br>
I use hundreds of programs, sometimes frequently, and sometimes infrequently. I have a lot of paid software, and a lot of software that I've donated to (because it's free, free). I've donated to classicshell twice, for instance. But paying nearly $40 USD (which is even more in my country) is just not going to make it worthwhile.<br>
<br>
And like the other poster, I ignore any options for subscription based licencing outright.</div>

That reasoning is flawed because Sandboxie FREE will protect your computer just fine. And if you owned many many computers you could put the free version on each one of them - forever. To use that gift against the developer by claiming it's not fair to pay the same amount of money for something you already own mostly is what is not fair.<br>
<br>
And for those who claim to be one of the good old friends, how is it you existed for so long on just the free version? If now the lifetime license is so important?</div>

First of all, think big, not everyone lives in a country using  Euros...and ooch, the tax <br>
Second of all, many protection software (internet security, antivirus), have multiyear license or even lifetime license.(which some freatures their own sandbox)<br>
finally, many protection software are cheaper then sandboxie, and if not, local store often have them on sale.<br>
