				<div class="content">I updated 4.14 to 4.16 on 3 different home computers and now they're all failing to open my browser IE. I'm getting errors about IE crashing and that "loader" error reported here by others. These are 64-bit systems, Win7 and Win8, fully updated. I have deleted and am going to re-download and reinstall just to see if it's the update process that triggered the problem.<br>
<br>
These are my home "free" installs. I haven't checked if my work licensed copies have the same problem but I'm not updating any of these until this problem is resolved.<br>
<br>
Just uninstalled on one of my Win7 home systems and downloaded the full 4.16 package and it seems to have installed fine, i.e. it's now working. So the update process was the problem, IMO.</div>
