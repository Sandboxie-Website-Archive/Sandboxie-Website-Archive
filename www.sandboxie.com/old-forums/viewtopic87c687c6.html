				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I am running a program that "might" be dangerous regarding its use of graphics cards memory and it does need internet access to run.<br>
<br>
I have setup a seperate normal user account for just that program to run in and have used NTFS permissions to block off all folders and drives except C:\windows. I have used GPO settings to block control panel and settings and regedit and powershell. The program does need the cmd though as well as windows gui forms etc.<br>
<br>
This program runs in the sandbox on that account used only for this program. NTFS permissions deny that account access to all browsers.<br>
<br>
Is it possible for the program to view other user's video memory - it does not run as admin and no permissions are asked? Also is the sandboxed program able to run key logging on other user accounts whilst running in the sandbox.<br>
<br>
All normal actions take place in other user accounts and outside of the sandbox. The "rogue" program runs in the sandbox.<br>
<br>
I tried using a legitimate keylogger to test if it could see outside the sandbox and it was not able to!<br>
<br>
The OS is Windows server 2016. <br>
<br>
I would appreciate all advice on if it can view outside the sandbox e.g. other user screen memory and keyboard events. And any other advice to lockdown the system.<br>
<br>
Thanks!!!</div>

<br>
Please include this information :<br>
<a href="viewtopic633b633b.html?f=11&amp;t=19746" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=19746</a><br>
Without knowing what programs you are using and how do they work, we cannot really provide much assistance.<br>
<br>
Does the program work in a new Sandbox with default settings? (Sandbox --&gt; Create new Sandbox  - Under "Copy settings from existing sandbox" select "none" ).  <br>
<br>
Regarding Windows Server, we do not officially support it, but we will try to help as much as possible.<br>
<br>
As for Applocker, and keyloggers please read these entries:<br>
