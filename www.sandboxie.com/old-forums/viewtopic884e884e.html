Not seeing it. Delete the contents of your Sandbox. I am having no problems in Chrome 48 or Beta 49 using SBIE 507.8...Win 10 64 (FR builds)</div></blockquote>

Hard to know what can be different. This is a fairly new and clean installation of W.10, so <em>should</em> be OK. I can only say that I get the messages when starting Chrome 48.0.2564.109 and that they don't arise if HitmanPro.Alert 3.1.7 Build 357 is stopped from running.<br>

Did Hitman Pro install a Google extension? If so, try disabling that.</div>

No, it didn't install an extension. I have tried the following:<br>
<br>
Disabled the few extensions installed.<br>
Created a 'New Person' profile.<br>
Thoroughly uninstalled Chrome and then reinstalled it.<br>
Disabled all protections in Avira Pro (right click on System Tray icon)<br>
Exited Nvidia GeForce Experience<br>
Stopped 'AdGuard' (a program under trial) running in both Startup and Windows Services.<br>
<br>
The only action that removes the error is stopping HitmanPro.Alert.<br>
<br>
It must be something to do with me since nobody else has reported the problem, although I have checked for system errors (sfc /scannow and Dism) and none show.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello.<br>
I am having a conflict problem with uTorrent client version 3.4.5 build 41712 (32 bit) (the latest version I think)<br>
I am running Windows 8.1 pro, with Avast Premier antivirus, ExpressVPN, and PeerBlock 1.2.<br>
<br>
Until just now I was running the beta version 5.07.5.  I noticed that 5.07.8 was out and tried that but it has no effect on this problem.<br>
<br>
uTorrent recently released the upgrade to build 41712 and I foolishly clicked on upgrade.  I do not know what the previous build number was and do not know how (or even whether it is possible) to go back to a previous version.  I do not know whether I should even be posting this here rather than in a forum dedicated to uTorrent.  I would just say that the latest build of uTorrent works ok outside the sandbox, and that the previous build of uTorrent worked perfectly in the sandbox (version 5.07.5 beta)<br>
<br>
Basically, I open my browser (IE 11) in a sandbox, and click on a magnet link to a torrent file.  It hesitates a bit, then attempts to load uTorrent in the sandbox, but the GUI only half loads and it periodically says "not responding".  If I leave it long enough I find that it has in fact downloaded the selected file, but with the GUI misbehaving I cannot monitor the file download process.<br>
<br>
Just letting you know.  Now off to find a uTorrent forum to say the same thing.<br>
<br>
Thanks, guys, love Sandboxie.</div>

We haven't tested torrent clients with SBIE. So the Beta's would not directly related to any known issues. <br>
<br>
What happens when you are not using Peer Block or VPN? Either one or both? And just uTorrent? (If you can...)<br>
<br>
Any one of those 2 could be the issue...or uTorrent itself..<br>
<br>
 When you're in a SB, some resources are blocked by default, and well, others will be much slower depending on how the program responds to being in that sb environment.</div>
