				<div class="content">I would like to play games through Sandboxie to play many copies of the same online games on a single PC with many controllers, or mouse and keyboards.<br>
So far so good! Got to play Team Fortress 2 with a friend on the same PC, but had to use the -nojoy command on the sandboxed version to force the game to not recognize my Xbox 360 controller. Not all games support that, so I'd like to be able to force a program to be unable to read some or all controllers directly through Sandboxie.<br>
So, isolating readable devices would be good, like, having many Wifis on my computer, but Sandboxie only allows to read one.<br>
One post and two requests... I'd like to force an application to only read x devices, and have support for multiple keyboards and mouses. Because not even Windows can distinguish one keyboard from the other! And it is possible to get the input from a single keyboard, because GlovePIE could do it.<br>
Could you please add these features to Sandboxie?<br>
Sorry if I have bad English, I don't know how to word some things very well...</div>
