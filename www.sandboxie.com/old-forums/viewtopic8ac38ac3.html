				<div class="content">Tzuk tell me, what prevents to make a separate language file (for example 1033.txt, 1049.txt, ...). And when you install Sandboxie, other languages are not installed. At the same time (I think) will optimize performance Sandboxie and improve feedback to improve the translation.<br>
Such a form for example:<br>
<br>
...<br>
3001,  	"&amp;OK"<br>
3002,  	"&amp;Cancel"<br>
3003,  	"&amp;Browse..."<br>

				<div class="content">I don't know if "prevents" is the right word here.  I would have to re-do the translation mechanism in Sandboxie and it's just not something in which I want to invest any more time, at least not when other important stuff are waiting to be addressed.<br>
<br>
You're right that some other method could be more effective for translators, but there would be no effect on performance.</div>

Yeah, I always thought that'd be easier for translators too, if all they had to do was just translate the English.ini to Italian.ini, Dutch.ini, French.ini, etc..<br>
However it would require recoding Sandboxie and moving all program strings to ini files, something I'm not sure tzuk wants to do right now considering he mentioned he wants to release 3.54 soon and will only revise current fixes that aren't working or causing issues. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>

				<div class="content">I can't easily simplify the way Sandboxie uses the message files, but please take a look here about setting up a build environment to build SbieMsg.dll. <br>
<br>
Please take a look here:<br>
<br>
<a href="../index5669.html?BuildingSbieMsgDll" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?BuildingSbieMsgDll</a><br>
<br>
I hope this doesn't scare you away ... Most of the set up has to be done just once.<br>
<br>
If you decide to give this a try, I'd like to know if the instructions are helpful or if anything was confusing.</div>
