				<h3>Missing e-mail notification for private message [SOLVED]</h3>

				<div class="content">About 12 hours ago I received I private message but did not receive an e-mail update. I have e-mail notifications enabled for private messages. I have in the past received other e-mail update to forum posts, so I don't know why I didn't receive a notice. Typically in the forums I visit when I receive a private message there is an immediate e-mail update sent to me. Can you look into this please, thanks</div>

I just tested this with a secondary account and received emails for every PM sent.<br>

Please double check that this setting is enabled for you:<br>
Click on Notifications --&gt; Settings  <br>
Look for---&gt;"Someone sends you a private message "<br>
Ensure the Email box is ticked and hit submit. <br>
<br>
I will send you a test PM to see if you receive the email.<br>

Any chance you have a spam filter that might be blocking "<a href="mailto:forum@sandboxie.com">forum@sandboxie.com</a>" ? <br>
Also, are you still using the same email address that you used when you registered to the forums? (Sorry if this is a silly question, just triple checking since I am getting the Emails). <br>

I will send you a PM as well, let's see if you receive an email.<br>

Yes it was that reply that I did not receive a notification for. I have replied to barb's test PM and asked her to reply back to me from that PM to see if it's an existing PM thread issue</div>

No - but I checked my spam to be sure
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Also, are you still using the same email address that you used when you registered to the forums? (Sorry if this is a silly question, just triple checking since I am getting the Emails). </div></blockquote>
Not silly at all! What is silly is that I can't find where this system holds my email  address <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed"> Can you help me out please.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I will send you a PM as well, let's see if you receive an email.</div></blockquote>
Received but no email.<br>
<br>
BTW I have "Users can contact me by email" set to "no" but both "notifications" and "email" for PMs ticked/allowed; and the Board notifications flag was set. I assume the Board system isn't just a user for emails. I rarely use it, but find the control panel awful (I realise you only use the software).<br>

I sent a reply to the PM, let's see if you get the email (I did get an email when you replied to me).<br>
Maye your email software groups up emails in conversations or something like that?<br>

I did receive a notification for the reply, thanks. Yes my e-mail does group however not for something like this. I guess it was just a network hiccup that I didn't receive that e-mail notification from the Syrinx PM.</div>

It looks like we are all set. I am marking this thread resolved.<br>
<br>
If you need another test, just send me a PM and I will reply so you can test you are receiving emails.<br>
