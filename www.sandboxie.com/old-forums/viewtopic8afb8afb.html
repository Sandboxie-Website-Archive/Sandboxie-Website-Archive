				<div class="content">I cannot even imagine how many people Tzuk has saved from having disasters on their PC's.<br>
<br>
So much malware that thanks to him became harmless for so many. Preventing so many nerve wrecking heartaches. <br>
<br>
Two times I even had a cracker on my laptop. My green disk light was burning solid for no apparent reason, laptop rattling like crazy. I moved the arrow to the right top of my screen to get away from that site, and not quite reaching the red button yet, I lifted my finger off the touch pad for a fraction of a second to make the arrow reach it with a second slide, and before I had my finger back on the pad, immediately the arrow shot away from it. I couldn't believe my eyes!<br>
I repeated the movement, and the arrow shot away again as soon as my finger was off the touch pad. We were fighting over the control of my laptop! <br>
<br>
I realized all this was taking place while sandboxed, so I relaxed and watched the frenzied activity for 5 minutes. Then I decided to give the visitor a surprise, and was able to quickly click End all programs, and gone was the site and the cracker. I loved it!   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
A short while later the same thing happened, only this time End all programs did not work (clever cracker!). So I simply kept the hardware Off button pressed until the laptop turned off. Same effect; nothing left after reboot.<br>
<br>
Thank you Tzuk, for saving so many of us from so many s..t loads of problems!</div>
