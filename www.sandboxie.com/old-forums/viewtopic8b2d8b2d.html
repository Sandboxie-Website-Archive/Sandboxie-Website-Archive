				<div class="content">Thanks for the clarification.  I can see this problem now.<br>
<br>
I just released version 4.04 a short while ago so the fix for this particular problem will have to wait a bit longer.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I'm not sure what I would be able to do about it.  It seems the file cannot be deleted because Windows Explorer itself holds on to it.  Even if you terminate the acrord32.exe processes in the sandbox, the file is still held and cannot be deleted.  But I will see what I can do.</div>

<br>
Ok, strange, on my system the file gets deleted seconds after I used the option "Terminate All Programs".<br>
<br>
I hope you can fix the problem in an upcoming release. Thanks for your hard work.</div>

				<div class="content">I looked into this but I don't see a way around it.  Even if the Acrobat process just terminates immediately when it is started this way, Windows Explorer still holds on to the PDF file for a while.  I'm sorry.</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you very much for your help. Ok, as this only happens on my 32-bit Windows 7, I think I can live with that strange behavior.<br>

(Sorry for my late reply. I was on vacation.)</div>
