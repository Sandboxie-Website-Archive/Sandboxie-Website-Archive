Hi Guess21.<br>
<br>
There are a fair number of threads on this forum and others related to your question.  A recent thread, with lots of posts and information, is here on Wilders: <a href="http://www.wilderssecurity.com/showthread.php?t=240008" class="postlink">http://www.wilderssecurity.com/showthread.php?t=240008</a>   If you don't want to read through all the posts in that thread, you may want to focus on post #88.  Bear in mind that this is one person's opinion (SSJ100), but it looks like he has had good success with his approach and others on Wilders have vetted his configuration with general approval.<br>
<br>
But having said that, I think it still boils down to a personal decision regarding how one configures his/her sandboxes.  I have one sandbox that I use for banking that I have configured pretty tightly.  I also have some "testing" sandboxes that are moderately tight.  But my browsing sandbox (that I use most often) primarily has default settings (except I restrict access to My Documents) and I feel comfortable with that.  I think you'll find that how you configure your sandboxes will evolve and is dependent on your experience with SBIE, your own risk/comfort level, and new features that tzuk adds.</div>
