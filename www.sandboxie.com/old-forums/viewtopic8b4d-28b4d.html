				<div class="content">The worst thing i know about windows is the registry and dll's. I am pretty good with computers but some programs simple mess up your computer so when i <br>
heard about this program i was a bit skeptical how it would actually work and now that i have tested it i am simply amazed how well it really works!!!<br>
<br>
i have not tested office 2007 but if it can handle big applications like that then i will surely donate to you <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
Only one thing i miss or i have not figured out is if it is possible to remove a single application.<br>
For ex if i have installed 2 programs using sandbox and i want to only remove one of them. <br>
<br>
Any way thanks for a awesome program. <br>
<br>
Cheers<br>

				<div class="content">i think i understand now. I can Simply create more sanboxes for different programs. Simply brilliant!!!<br>
<br>
This program deserve some cash hehe. Not that often i fall in love with a program to be honest! <br>
<br>
Any chance this could be ported for osx ? Although the majority of OSX programs are simple to install, but there are bigger programs like adobe , office and other that can be a pain to remove. With this program you can run them as long as needed.<br>
It is awsome that you can actually keep your windows as clean as ever now. Just install all programs in separate sandboxes and when a new version of the program comes i can remove the sandbox and install the new one. No need for uninstallation which really never remove all the files anyway.</div>
