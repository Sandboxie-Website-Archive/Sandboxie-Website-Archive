Having the same issue deleting firefox &amp; opera, beta 5.21.6 doesn't solve this issue. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed"> <br>

Only way to delete is to shut down webroot secureanywhere completely.</div>

When you get a Sandboxie message that says, "Could not move the sandbox folder out of the way. The object (file or folder) may be in use by another program....", usually is your antivirus locking files inside the sandbox while doing its thing as you close the sandboxd program and delete the sandbox.<br>
<br>
Since you the know the problem goes away if you shut down Webroot, perhaps for now you can workaround the issue by excluding the Sandbox folder in C in Webroot Exclusions. You can also try adding to exclusions all of Sandboxies process that you find in the Sandboxie folder in Program files. Another thing you can do is at least temporarily uninstall Webroot and use Windows defender. I dont use an AV but I tested WD for about 36 hours after updating to FCU. I found no issue whatsoever with Sandboxie. I don't use Opera but Firefox is my browser. WD, Sandboxie and Firefox get along very well right now, as usual.<br>

FWIW ~ WebrootSA does not offer exclude by folder (only file).   Sandboxie processes are allowed.   SbieCtrl was Monitor for a short time with 5.21.6.  Now, my Sandboxie active processes are all Allow.   Note: I'm still AU so, no help re FCU.

I was finally able to get Weboroot SecureAnywhere and tested it on a Win 10 x64 FCU + Sbie Beta 5.21.7. <br>
I encountered no issues deleting the contents of the Sandbox. I tested with different sandboxes creating files, using browsers (Chrome 62), etc...<br>
<br>
Can I get exact repro steps? <br>

				<div class="content">Updated Sandboxie to 5.21.7.  Still cannot delete contents of sandbox while Webroot is running.  Same as before: If I "shut down protection" from Webroot using its menu, I can delete the sandbox contents.  I have tried removing Chrome from Webroots "Application Protection", and I have tried whitelisting all of Sandboxie's exe and dll files.  Those steps did not work.  I have also tried turning off various shields and reducing heuristics; nothing worked.<br>
<br>
Any guidance from Sandboxie or others who have a solution would be appreciated.  Thank you<br>
