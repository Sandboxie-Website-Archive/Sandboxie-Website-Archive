				<div class="content">Hi there<br>
<br>
I've found Sandboxie as I'm looking for a solution to a specific problem.<br>
<br>
What I'm wanting, is to unzip and virus check some unknown .zips, and take some files out of that .zip and if they scan clean, save them onto the computer. So I want to use Sandboxie to unzip them in isolation.<br>
<br>
The computer that Sandboxie will be installed on runs Kaspersky Total Security 2017 with Malwarebytes used as an additional scan (but not background running).<br>
<br>
My questions are:<br>
<br>
Q1<br>
If these security programs are installed on the OS (Windows 7), can they look inside the Sandbox and scan what's in it? This may be a very obvious question and I realise I probably don't fully understand the mechanics of the sandbox which is why I'm asking!<br>
<br>
Q2 If the files scan clean can I save them outside the sandbox, just onto the hard drive as any other file or are they 'trapped' in the sandbox and can only be used in isolation with Sandboxie running?<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you</div>

Depending on your Antivirus you may need to follow different steps to scan the Sandboxed files. But the answer is yes, you can.<br>
Here's an example that might help you:<br>

<br>
And here's a thread about unzipping viruses inside Sandboxie:<br>

<br>
As for Kaspersky, there are a few tweaks required in order for it to work properly, please have a look at this thread for instructions:<br>

You can transfer the files back to your computer, once you are sure they are safe. This can be accomplished by using the Sandboxie recovery options, or by manually copying the files via Windows Explorer. Your sandbox location on your hard drive is typically C:\Sandbox \User Name\ Sandbox Name\...Location to your files.<br>
<br>
Recovery Options:<br>

<a href="../indexd951.html?ImmediateRecovery" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?ImmediateRecovery</a><br>
<br>
Please let us know if you need further clarification or if you have any additional questions.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>
