				<h3>Chrome bookmarks and Sandboxie [SOLVED]</h3>

				<div class="content">In Firefox, if you save a bookmark when the browser is being run inside a sandbox, it won't save. However I've noticed this is not the case with Chrome. <br>
<br>
After updating sandboxie to 5.24 yesterday I ran Chrome (latest version) inside my default sandbox and without thinking, I saved a site to my bookmarks. Realising what I'd done, I then opened Chrome (via a separate un-sandboxed browser) and discovered that the site I'd just bookmarked in a sandboxed session had been already been added to my bookmarks. If it's relevant, I am signed into my Chrome browser with a google account, so I'm not sure if it's being saved by google &amp; then added by my google account, or it's an action that's escaping the sandbox.<br>
<br>
I read ages ago on these forums that there is some sort of hack you can do in the sandboxie settings to allow bookmarks in a sandboxed web browser to save outside of the sandboxed session, but I have not made any such alteration as I want to keep my sandbox as tight as possible.<br>
<br>
Would someone mind confirming if this is being done by google or by sandboxie, and if it's by sandboxie, if this is by design or not. My feeling is it's probably google but I'd like to check it out.

<br>
If you are logged in to Chrome, you are probably sharing your data across any other devices you log in to, you will need to refer to their documentation for further info:<br>
<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/165139?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en" class="postlink">https://support.google.com/chrome/answe ... ktop&amp;hl=en</a><br>
<br>
Regarding Sandboxie, we have templates to allow bookmars and the likes to be saved outside the Sandbox, please see:<br>
<a href="../FirefoxTips.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/FirefoxTips</a><br>
The same tips apply to Chrome, you will see a template for it as well. <br>
<br>
I am moving this thread to Quick Questions for the time being.<br>
<br>
If you would like to report a problem, please follow these guidelines:<br>
