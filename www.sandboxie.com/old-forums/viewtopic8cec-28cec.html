				<h3>Skype Without a Microsoft Account</h3>

				<div class="content">I have Windows 8 and setting up Skype via the apps page of Metro requires one to have or make a Microsoft Account. Even downloading/installing the default offered version directly from Skype's site does that. Unless one chooses the Desktop version I found out... so that is what I have on my laptop now. <br>
<br>
It tuns out one has to put one's picture on it now, otherwise it won't install. Webcam picture can be taken during install.<br>
<br>
First I tried to install a version from before Microsoft bought Skype which I still had on a memory stick, But Microsoft won't let it be activated now. It gave an error message every time I tried.</div>

				<div class="content">Never thought of that. So simple! And that while I had taped off my default webcam after installing Skype. This because I have a Logitech C615 webcam, which I only set on the edge of my screen and plug in when I'm going to Skype, which is not often.<br>
<br>
Anyway, of course I don't mind my contacts seeing my picture. It's just that Microsoft is becoming so NWO Big Brother like. When at first I wanted to get a Microsoft account to be able to upgrade my Windows 8 to Windows 8.1, I saw a long list -checked by default- with things like "Microsoft has the right to use your name for advertising purposes.", "Microsoft has the right to use your picture for advertising purposes.", "Microsoft has the right to use your apps for advertising purposes." etc, etc.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> <br>
<br>
I decided not to "upgrade" to Windows 8.1, nor to get a Microsoft account.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>
