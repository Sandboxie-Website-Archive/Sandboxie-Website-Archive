				<h3>Mouse is spinning inside sandboxed Games [SOLVED]</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sat Apr 22, 2017 5:53 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Theres a bug in a few sandboxed Games like Minecraft, Garry's Mod and Black Ops (most Games work just fine): The mouse is spinning crazy fast in circles! Not in the menus, only as soon as I am inside the Gameplay. I switched to a different mouse to see if it is a driver problem but it is still spinning. I also uninstalled the games, rebooted and installed them again. Still spinning.<br>
Why is that? Why those games in particular?  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?:" title="Question"><br>
<br>
Edit: Maybe this helps: If I change the resolution of Black Ops and Garry's Mod to 1280x720 it works! But not at 1600x900 or 1920x1080 (Windows scaling is at 125% but still the same problem when deactivating scaling for high DPI for those particular games)!</div>

				<div class="content">When I configure Windows scaling back to 100% instead of 125% it works! But this makes text almost impossible for me to read. Is there any way to solve this?</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Creave,<br>
<br>
What are your OS, Sandboxie and Antivirus versions? What's your Desktop resolution? <br>
Can you provide  exact repro steps for Garry's Mode so that I can test the behavior? <br>
<br>
See if this helps:<br>

				<div class="content">Solved the problem! The Windows 10 DPI scaling was the issue. Prevent this from happening by not changing the scaling settings.</div>
