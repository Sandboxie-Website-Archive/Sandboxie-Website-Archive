No change I'm afraid with clean install or over the top install.  Forced Folder or Forced App doesn't make any difference. Neither does right click send to.<br>

Tzuk, not sure what else I can tell you. No Office apps work. The app starts in the Sandbox then fails with no error message from SBIE with the exception of Excel which gives a Windows prompt that cannot communicate with the device, path or file and from .12 SBIE gives SBIE2335 Initialization failed for process EXCEL.EXE [55 / 8] as well. <br>
<br>
Neither SandboxieRpcSs or SandboxieDcomLaunch appear to start other than in the 'send to' scenario. IntegratedOffice.exe does not start either but I don't know that it should, just its linked to Office 2013 functionality.  I've attached the Resource Access Monitor for Word, Excel  Outlook in the hope that helps.<br>
<br>
Thanks</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the log.  I see that you have Office that uses Microsoft's App-V virtualization engine.  I'm afraid I don't have a solution to make Sandboxie work with that type of Office.  There is an old topic that discusses this.  I'm sorry.<br>

Thanks for looking at it anyway Tzuk. <br>
<br>
For others thinking about using the 2 together it is theOffice2013 Pro-Plus version (same version I used in Office 2010 with no issues). I was unaware it used App-V. I look to see if I can install it a different way.<br>
<br>

				<div class="content">To finish this one off just to confirm I downloaded the offline installer, re-installed without App-V and all is working well.<br>
<br>
A happy man now.<br>
