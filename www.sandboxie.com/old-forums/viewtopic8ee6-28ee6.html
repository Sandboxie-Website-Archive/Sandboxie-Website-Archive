I went ahead and contacted Norton. Spent a great deal of time providing screenshots, data, etc. Turns out it's blocking sbiecsvc.exe. I submitted a "false positive" report at <a href="https://submit.symantec.com/false_positive/" class="postlink">https://submit.symantec.com/false_positive/</a> so hopefully this will get cleared up since disabling the Norton Exploit Prevention feature severely limits the protection provided by all the Norton products. I encourage anyone else having similar problem to submit this as well.
</div></blockquote>

Why couldn't tech support and or developers at Sandboxie diagnose and collaborate with Symantec like  brw11 did or like I found the issue with Symantec Enterprise Protection in my last post to get this problem fixed. Everyone here at Sandboxie support is saying this has been a long time issue? Suggesting to uninstall Norton or SEP in not a solution. Very disappointing!</div>

Hi Exile, I tell you, the bottom line is that today, the problem is being caused by enabling Generic Exploit Mitigation, yesterday it was the browser addons thatt caused issues with Sandboxie, and tomorrow? Who knows whats gonna be but something in Norton is going to mess with SBIE. There is always something in Norton conflicting with SBIE that blocks SBIE from working properly. As a Sandboxie user, I want Sandboxie to be effective at 100%, all the time, and that cant happen if you are using Norton (thats my opinion, is unfortunate but is the honest truth).<br>

				<div class="content">I've been using Norton for years on all my computers along with Sandboxie and have always been able to get them to work together. Sometimes it takes a little tweaking but it's always worked out. This is the first time it came down to disabling a key, and very important, Norton feature. Norton is still one of the best overall lines of defense out there. I've not only asked Norton to whitelist this particular module but requested they add the ability for users to do that themselves as they can with the firewall feature. No point in throwing the baby out with the bath!</div>

See, thats the thing. I am not into constantly tweaking or doing workarounds for programs to work flawlessly with Sandboxie. If a program (like Norton) constantly messes up with SBIE, I rather use something else. I don't know about you, but I run just about every file and program that run in my computers sandboxed every time they run. Files I download, they run sandboxed during their lifetime in the PC. When you use Sandboxie that way, you dont want the AV to block files when you click them and expect them to open sandboxed immediately, with no delay. Antiviruses like Norton can cause delays when you run a fle sandboxed and when you delete the sandbox. Also, sometimes antiviruses can cause the sadbox not to delete when you close the sandboxed program. This are some of the reasons why I think its better to use an AV that gets along very well with SBIE. Perhaps, if you only run your browser sandboxed, then you can live with the AV interfering with SBIE but when the only time you are not using SBIE is when the PC is idle, then I think its better to get an AV that work flawlessly with SBIE.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>

If you search for Norton in the forum, you ll see the complains about incompatibility issues are constant and they go back years. There has always been issues between the 2 programs. But, I am glad you got both programs working fine now.<br>
