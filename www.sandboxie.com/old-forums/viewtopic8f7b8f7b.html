I still have the update, I uninstalled flash then installed the beta flash. I was going to roll back the update, but decided just to disabled flash all together and give it a try. I have not had any problems just doing this with FF 41.0.1 &amp; Sandboxie -- everything seems to work fine. Firefox released an update which I will install next and give that a try too.<br>

FF or flash update would have nothing to do with SBIE. They're fixing their own specific problems.</div>

What???<br>
<br>
Your Sandboxie Start Page, Home, Help&amp;FAQ, Download and Buy doesn´t reply.<br>
The Download links for the new Beta 5.05.2 also doesn´t reply.<br>
The only Site who works is the Forum.<br>
If I click the download links I get the message "This Website is not available!"<br>
