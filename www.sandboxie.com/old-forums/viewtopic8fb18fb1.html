<br>
For someone with years of experience using sandboxie Wittman doesn't know SBIE limitation well enough, making claims of SBIE being impregnable, suggesting not updating MS, nor having an AV(which even Tzuk advice one should have), etc... if not for such claim that conversation wouldn't have dragged on. As for the other guy he did made some point, as do others occasionally pointing out flaws and some of which even POC of a bypass in SBIE which Invincea handled well in fixing.</div></blockquote>

Fine, but if Wittman gives his opinion and it is not perfect, then so what. Opinions are open to being imperfect, it is no crime to exaggerate or get something wrong, people  do it all the time.  After all it is only a chat Forum, not a Court of Law. Wittman is no authorised spokesman for Sandboxie, he is a spokesman for Wittmann.<br>
<br>
And if Wittmann`s opinions show Sandboxie in glorious technicolour, albeit with some exaggeration and slightly bent claims, then I am all in favour of publicising Sandboxie as impregnable. It is not a dictionary expression we are  considering, it is a term used in lieu of damned brilliant. Even bad press can be good press ! It means that the subject is <strong>in the news</strong>, people are talking about it and that can only be good.<br>
<br>
Nitpicking at what exactly Wittmann said serves no useful purpose in the overall context of portraying Sandboxie as the  best thing since sliced bread.<br>
<br>
All I can say is "carry on Wittman - ride `em cowboy !"</div>

				<div class="content">Yabbadoo, don't let Nixs post bother you. You wanted to expose your friends at the Cable forum to Sandboxie, and you accomplish that.

You done good for the people in that forum and one day, a few of them will appreciate what you done.<br>
<br>
 I always say that "I was lucky to discover Sandboxie and smart choosing to use it." No one told me about Sandboxie, when I discovered it, I was in the process of looking for something that protected better than antiviruses. I had just recently learned that antiviruses was not the only technology available. So, all the sudden, I had 100 programs that I had never heard about in front of my face, all but one claiming to be the best ever. The one program that didn't claim nothing was the one that catch my attention, that was Sandboxie. I liked what I read about it and what I heard in the video and podcast that I posted for your friends from the UK. And years later, I feel Sandboxie can be described using the old African proverb made famous by Theodore Roosevelt (Speak softly and carry a big stick). That is Sandboxie. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>

I'm not here to argue w/ anyone, if Yabbadoo was bothered that's good as he understand my point of view. Don't get me wrong he(Wittman) did manage to expose people on that forum to SBIE which is good,  my point is we as SBIE users should provide info base on fact/claims by the developers and It's best not to exaggerate.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">  <br>

What happened in that forums is just a minor scuffle, just an example remember this: <a href="http://labs.bromium.com/2013/07/23/application-sandboxes-a-pen-testers-perspective/" class="postlink">http://labs.bromium.com/2013/07/23/appl ... rspective/</a>... this stir up doubts on sandboxing "before" and a cause for real debate, qasdfdsaq luckly didn't point out or base his arguments with, would have been much more difficult to argue with.</div>

You talk about being best not to exaggerate but you are doing it now. You are exaggerating the validity of Bromiums claim, you take what they said as fact when in reality their paper means nothing in the real world. Its been more than two years since they released their garbage and no SBIE user has gotten infected by anything based on what they said. And it will remain like that forever and ever. That is fact <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool">.<br>

You did when you said the Bromium paper stirs up doubts on sandboxing. What they said might of shaken your confidence in SBIE but you shouldn't assume that it did so in other people who know SBIE. I am just one user but to me personally, what they said or claim mean nothing more than when I see one company advertizing their product and trying to make their competition look bad. Thats exactly what Bromium did.<br>
<br>
I think the Bromium paper causes damage to Sandboxie in how the program is perceived by people who don't know Sandboxie who read the paper. That bothers me. I think, you posting the link to their garbage in this thread make what they said look valid in the eyes of people who never heard of SBIE. I replied to your post so new SBIE users who read this thread understand that no Sandboixe user to this day has gotten infected by anything based on the Bromium report and the chances of any Sandboxie user ever getting infected by what they claim are about 0. <br>
<br>
You used Sandboxie for a while, you should know that one can spend hours and hours searching the internet for SBIE users getting infected or for real malware that escapes the sandbox and you wont find any. Thats the power of Sandboxie. Cheers, Nix.<br>

				<div class="content">Bo Elam and his expertise has done more to promote the benefits of Sandboxie than most of the web articles I have read other than those emanating from the actual Sandboxie organisation.<br>
<br>
And you must realise that poor old Wittmann is fighting a lone battle, on his own with no support from any Sandboxie experts.<br>
If he has said a few things that are not perfect, then so what. He has put up a good fight for Sandboxie and rightly or wrongly has blasted Sandboxie into the spotlight around those parts. Making people aware of the program  when they most likely never knew it existed or certainly never knew any details before Wittmann hit the keyboard with his OP.<br>
<br>
Most of the critics on that Forum are most certainly traditional AV people who hate to be told that a virtual system which does not depend on a data base, knocks their permanently outdated security set-ups for six. Of course we all have an AV working alongside Sandboxie, but we do not rely upon it. Simply a complementary protection device.<br>
<br>
I do not think that Wittman gives a toot about most of their comments, he has done his job to the best of his ability and simply sits back satisfied that Sandboxie has been given a good measure of exposure all  due to him.</div>

Thanks Curt.<br>
<br>
Well, Wittmann and his Sandboxie Soapbox has attracted as of now 1,578 views and  climbing, that can`t be a bad deal for over-enthusiasm. Pretty wide exposure for some guy shooting his mouth off. What does a few exaggerations and inexactitudes matter when you attract an audience, getting the subject in the limelight is the target.  Politicians do it all the time.<br>
<br>
Not all those viewers are mentally immune to Sandboxie`s magnetic magic when they check up on the Sandboxie site and read other web articles about the program. Forum threads are an excellent means of advertising a product.</div>
