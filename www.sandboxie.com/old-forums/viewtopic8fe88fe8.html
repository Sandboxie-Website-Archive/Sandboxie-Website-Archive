it´s the first time, i´ve installed sandboxie on a Windows 10 System. So i´ve tried to install the latest Beta 5.03.3. After installing and rebooting the System, i get anytime on Starting a program Sandboxed the following error:<br>
SBIE2224 Sandboxed program has crashed: SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe<br>
It doesn´t matter how i start programs (wether to right click in sandbox control on the sandbox -&gt; Run Sandboxed -&gt; Run Web Browser or Run Any Program...<br>
Also i tried to right click on a program on my system (explorer), and choose "Run Sandboxed". Everytime the same error occurs.<br>
But at the Sandboxie Control is shows me the following programs still as active, after closing the error message:<br>
Start.exe<br>
SandboxieRpcSs.exe<br>
SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe<br>
WerFault.exe<br>
<br>
When i´m now trying to start a new sandboxed program (actual no one of the other programs were terminated), i´ve got the window like "Run Any Program" or "Run from Start Menu".. But the programs are not shown, only a new "start.exe" occurs within the sanboxie control..<br>
<br>
what can i do?<br>
Thank you very much <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":-)" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>

One, I would delete the contents of your sandbox, This will also force close any running programs. Are you running any Antivirus software?</div></blockquote>

Hi Craig,<br>
deleting the contents did not help. btw, i also created a new clean sandbox.<br>
But i´m running an Antivirus software (Bitdefender 2015)</div>

We opened these because we were getting a lot of support issues with PDF writers (mostly) that were trying to write to these folders.  The reasoning was, that if someone uses spoolsv to write malware to one of these folders, they still have to figure out a way to execute it.

Well, I think I more less understand such issues, even such changes as defaults. But if you implement such workarounds, please give us a way to disable such 'features' completely in Sandboxie settings. I'm stuck with 5.01.13 ATM. Thanks for reply</div>

Updates like this 1 weaken the protection of SandBoxie......IMHO,if some1 wants to print an internet file,be it a webpage or a whatever file,they should download it to their computer and recover from SandBoxie to print it,NOT directly from SandBoxie's sandbox.... <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

</div></blockquote>

Yikes I don't understand why you'd want to shoot yourself in the foot there! You had a decent start but if it's that bad of an option, why not shower the (mostly empty) page with warnings (or an extra 'are you sure prompt') instead? I hate to play the devils advocate here as I'm actually not against manually altering the ini but in order to 'appeal to the masses' a click-able option like you had would be ideal with a few extra warnings in the mix. [pardon the drunk speak] In my opinion it's easier to forget the manual changes as they aren't shown in the interface.</div></blockquote>

So a gui option was too risky but forcing open paths on everyone isn't....wow<br>
Why not just bring back this GUI option and add those paths as a toggle selection there set to false by default? Everyone wins, no potential holes permanently opened just for the convenience of others....but it can still be opened if it is needed by the specific user.</div>

We are aware of it. But it's on the low list of priorities, and we're not even sure if this is directly a SBIE issue.</div>

@Curt:<br>
You may keep this feature out of the box for those who value comfort over security,<br>
but for those of us who truly value security, please give us a way to disable this feature <br>
(even if it requires digging in and editing the sandboxie.ini file or something similar). <br>
That way, we would have a way to 'opt out' of this rather 'dangerous' (imho) precedent. <br>
Many thanks!</div>

Hi Pete, if the file is malware and it has to be run out of the sandbox in order to print it, I ll get infected.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>
