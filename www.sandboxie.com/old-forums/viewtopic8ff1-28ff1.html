				<div class="content">Hi.<br>
<br>
I'm having some issues with Excel ever since I updated Windows and Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
OS: Windows 7 64-bit<br>
Sandboxie 5.23.3 64-bit<br>
MS Excel 2007<br>
Issue: When I try to open an *.csv or *.xlsx file, nothing shows up. <br>
<br>
When it happens: This is where it gets tricky. It happens in certain conditions.<br>
1. When I try to open the file through My Computer and right-click "Run Sandboxed".<br>
2. When I download the file through an internet browser that is a forced program and open it from the browser's sandbox.<br>
<br>
When it doesn't happen:<br>
1. When I open the file from a forced folder. Strangely enough, when I run Windows Explorer outside the sandbox but open a file from a forced folder, the file will open fine in the sandbox.<br>
2. When I have MS Excel as a forced program and open the file from an unsandboxed Windows Explorer.<br>
<br>
This is an inconvenience really but it can be annoying. Hope you guys can look into this.<br>
<br>
<br>
-------MERGED POST-------<br>
I just checked with MS Word 2007, same issues. Haven't tried yet with other versions of MS Office applications.</div>

Meaning Excel doesn't start, or no file is shown inside Excel? <br>
<br>
If no file is shown inside Excel, this may be related to an existing issue with DDE:<br>

<br>
We do not test Office 2007, so I won't be able to replicate the issue. But here are some things to test:<br>
Try a new Sandbox with default settings, try disabling any Antivirus software (if present). If you have any addons in Office 2007, try launching it without them and see if the problem persists. <br>
<br>

Thanks for the link. I will look into the DDE issue. But this just started after I patched Windows and updated to the beta version.<br>

				<div class="content">I've tried the DDE workaround, but since it's not for MS Office 2007, had to do a little editing. Didn't work though or I didn't edit it right.<br>
<br>
Anyways, the problem persists only on MS Excel and Word when doing Click to Run or when opening from a browser. But it doesn't happen to MS Powerpoint or Publisher.</div>

				<div class="content">As someone tells all his customers to buy and use Sandboxie, I think Sandboxie should work with all currently supported Microsoft products because of macros.  It's a selling point I use to sell Sandboxie.  I have already had two customers with Word and Excel 2007 not work in Sandboxie.  Not protecting Word and Excel is a big deal and would make me look for something else because macro viruses are back.  Please, please, please don't blow this off.<br>
<br>
Bye the way, I'm automating PC installs.  Who do I talk to about silent installing Sandboxie including licensing and configurations and Sandboxie.ini changes I make for my customers.<br>
<br>
Thanks</div>

<br>
Regarding Office 2007, please see:<br>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3198497/office-2007-approaching-end-of-extended-support" class="postlink">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/hel ... ed-support</a><br>
<br>
The post is related to the fact that documents will not open directly in Sandboxed Office applications (so you have to run the Office app in the sandbox, and then use File--&gt; Open to access the desired files). That's a DDE issue, other than that, you should be able to use it in the Sandbox (ymmv). <br>
<br>
