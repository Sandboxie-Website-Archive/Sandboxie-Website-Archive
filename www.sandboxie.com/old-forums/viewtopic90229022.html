The Devs saw your post, and I can also confirm that we are not seeing freezing in Chrome. Are we seeing random crashes in Chrome in Win 10? Yes. In torture testing it's happening. But not all the time. As for the freezing, that can be several things. From A/V Installed (tool bar or add-ons) to a bum install of Chrome. <br>
<br>
But freezing, No. And Chrome is my default browser in testing. I'm in it all the time...and with that, I have not seen the crashing that's been confirmed, but the tests and Devs are aware and it's being looked at, but I certainly have not seen freezing. Nor have we had any reports of that sort of issue. <br>
<br>
If you want to provide me of software you have installed, you can do this:<br>
Open Power Shell (as admin) and type:<br>
 <br>
<strong> Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product | Select-Object -Property Name &gt; C:\Software\PCapps.txt</strong> <br>
<br>
The PCapps.txt will be created listing your software, Please email that to <a href="mailto:support@sandboxie.com">support@sandboxie.com</a></div>

Network printer issues. I have a couple different printers that are shared among my family members and when printing via Sandboxie, the printer spooler issue pops up. I can get rid them only by setting the openfilepath but I'm thinking I'm going to eventually setup the AllowSpoolerPrintToFile=y setting once I find it.<br>
<br>
And for those that mention that I would open up a security hole, I don't believe there is a way to execute whatever is saved via the spooler and inconvenience of the block (without a remember option) is incredibly large.</div>

If you use AllowSpoolerPrintToFile, malware can write a binary to your startup folder that will be run the next time you restart. A rather sizable hole.<br>
<br>
Just copy whatever OpenFilePath setting you are using to everyone's sandboxie.ini.</div>

Wow. I didn't realize malware could direct where it will be saved via spooler. So, is there a script that can append these settings? If I not, would writing a script that updates Windows\Sandboxie.ini (with admin permissions) achieve the same result as editing Sandboxie.ini via the Sandboxie Control?</div>

The installers are larger because they now include the MSVC libraries we require.</div>

				<div class="content">Uncheck protected mode in Flash. If that's the plug in that's causing the issue. If that is already un-ticked, you may need to see what plug in that is causing the issue. <br>
<br>
However, the Flash plug in issue was fixed in Beta 5.05.2. So I don't think that would be the issue, but confirm, then try one plug in at a time.<br>
<br>
As for plug ins, we tested and addressed that issue with Flash that was broken in the Patch Tuesday event. Could there be other plug in affected. Possibly. Normally, we just test the vanilla core browser. But the flash plug in was tested (as of flash beta 19) with 5.05.2 since the 15th.</div>

				<div class="content">For firefox go to the addon manager &gt; plugins and disable "protected mode" for flash in [settings].<br>
<br>
commonly the plugin-container crashes when web access is missing or some other security software is blocking it.<br>
i never had this issue but i dont use some antivirus or other behavior blocker. in firewall it is allowed and MBAE dont cause any issue.<br>
<br>
the plugin-container is also started by any other plugin so if its not flash  you have to do research<br>
get process explorer and determine the process which plugin is loaded<br>
