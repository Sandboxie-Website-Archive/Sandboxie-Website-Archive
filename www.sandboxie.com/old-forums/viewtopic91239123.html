<br>
Hopefully sooner or later someone will be able to identify that after installing some third party software X, or making some configuration change Y to Windows, they start seeing this error 0xC0000142, and perhaps then I can reproduce the problem and fix it.</div>

Same here, I've disabled the behaviour shield in Avast 8.0.1489 and the infamous error 0xC0000142 is gone (only while the shield is down, if I enable it again, the error comes back). Hope that helps. Regards!</div>

				<div class="content">I had the same problem with Newsleecher. The bad boy is the heuristic analysis of my virusscanner Bitdefender. This option has the not so informative name "Active Virus Control". Disabling it resolved the error. After adding Newsleecher to the excluded process list in Bitdefender, I could run it with the heuristic analysis turned on.<br>
<br>
I didn't have this problem with Sandboxie 3.76, so 4.04 seems to behave suspiciously according to Bitdefender and apparently others scanners as well.<br>

				<div class="content">I concur.   Turning off Avast! Behavior Shield allows Website-Watcher to run in Sandboxie 4.04.<br>
<br>
I tested further by changing the settings in Avast!'s Behavior Shield.<br>
<br>
I left Behavior Shield on and turned off the "Monitor the system for unauthorized modifications" setting in the Behavior Shield.  With this setting "unchecked", and everything else "checked", and Behavior Shield running, Website-Watcher runs under Sandboxie 4.04</div>

				<div class="content">Hi, I also had the same problem with several of my games, and they all worked fine once i turned off the option "Monitor the system for unauthorized modifications" under behavior shield settings. I actually set it off when starting then turned it back on once it was running but the game kept on working fine so it seems to only matter when applications are starting, or when sandboxie is initializing.<br>
Btw, it used to work perfectly fine in ver 3.x<br>
<br>
Hope it gets fixed</div>

No, not avast!. I started a thread sometime ago reporting about my problem, and that we're using Microsoft Security Essentials. I also mentioned, back then, that because we're dealing with a system on a SMB we cannot simply uninstall MSE to verify whether or not its the cause.<br>
<br>
This is the thread in question: <a href="../phpbb/viewtopic3845.php?t=15096" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=15096</a><br>
<br>
One use also reported there that he/she also has the same issue, but is using Avira, not MSE. The other security application in common with that other user is Microsoft EMET.<br>
<br>
I started that thread near the end of March (3 months and half ago), and I don't want to sound rude, but you simply never replied back to that thread, at all. That's unfortunate.</div>
