				<div class="content">Hi, when I have Windows Live Mail running sandboxed, is it possible to configure it in such a way that received emails are set as a recovery item before the sandbox is emptied of its contents ?<br>
<br>
Any responses appreciated<br>
<br>

				<div class="content">Most email reader programs will give you a message from Sandboxie that the program has not been configured to run sandboxed, if you don't use the template for that program.<br>
That's to prevent loss of emails while running sandboxed.<br>
<br>
Do you mean keep the emails in the sandbox until Quick Recovery is run (manually or during Delete Contents), instead of allowing them out immediately - which is what the Live Mail template does?<br>
<br>
From looking at the template for Live Mail I see that it allows direct access to a couple of folders for Live Mail and Live Contacts, as well as Registry keys and a Live Mail service. And that access is given to two .exe programs.<br>
Deciding how much of that to allow would be the problem, if the Live Mail template isn't used, in addition to selecting the appropriate Recovery folders.</div>

Yes I mean keep the emails in the sandbox until Quick Recovery is run (manually or during Delete Contents), instead of allowing them out immediately <br>
<br>
I tried the built in template and it didnt seem to work that way though ?</div>

				<div class="content">No, you're right. The template allows emails to be saved outside of the sandbox, assuming that your setup uses the default location for stored emails.<br>
The idea is that you should always run the email program sandboxed, and therefore any malware that may be in an email will be confined to the sandbox after the email is opened - and then deleted when the email program is ended.<br>
Forcing the program to run sandboxed is recommended, if a registered version of Sandboxie is available.<br>
<br>
In the case of some email programs, it's easy to keep emails in the sandbox and set up a Quick Recovery folder for them.<br>
They aren't as complicated as Live mail.<br>
<br>
In this case, there are multiple .exe's and the service that would have to be taken into account.<br>
Should the Registry keys still be allowed direct access, and what do you do about access to the service?<br>
These are questions that I can't answer.</div>
