				<div class="content">As the title says, Office 2016 fails to launch when I try to run it sandboxed. I'm using 32 bit office on 64 bit windows 10 anniversary updated. My sandboxie is registered and version is 5.16 (64 bit). When I try to run as administrator, it says could not invoke program.<br>
System error code:<br>
%1 is not a valid Win32 application.<br>
(193)<br>
 When I try to run it without administrator access, it says<br>
Something went wrong. We couldn't start your program. Please try starting it again.<br>
<br>
Microsoft Office click to run is checked in Software Compatibility options. What am I doing wrong?</div>

<br>
Are you trying to open the application itself (Word, Excel, etc...) or a file? <br>
If a file--&gt;Are they opening directly in Office outside Sbie? (If not, you will have to associate the file type to the program).<br>
<br>
Any chance you have changed the installation path for Sandboxie (meaning, other than the default) ?<br>
Please have a look at this: <br>
<a href="viewtopic91049104.php?f=2&amp;t=23015&amp;hilit=something+went+wrong&amp;start=15#p122288" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 15#p122288</a><br>
<br>
Make sure to update the template to the correct location, if needed. Then reboot and re-try (empty the contents of your Sandbox first). <br>
<br>
If you are still experiencing issues, please let us know if other applications launch and if you have any Antivirus software installed.<br>

I'm trying to open a docx file from the file explorer, it launches in Office 2016 perfectly outside sandboxie.<br>

No, installation path is the default C:\Program Files\Sandboxie<br>

I fiddled around with Sandboxie some more after I posted this thread &amp; was able to fix this. Until now, I only had 1 sandbox, that is the DefaultBox. It's settings were customized to my liking. Sandboxie refused to open Office 2016 under that sandbox.<br>
<br>
So I created a new sandbox named Office_2016 with default settings and tried to launch Office 2016 in it &amp; guess what? It worked. Now when I tried to launch the office file in my first defaultbox sandbox without changing any settings, to my surprise, it worked &amp; launched properly. Now, when I deleted my second sandbox i.e. Office_2016, office 2016 again stopped working for DefaultBox. The presence of a second sandbox somehow makes office 2016 work in both sandboxes, else office 2016 just refuses to work. Weird behavior, but I'm happy I'm able to launch office 2016 whatsoever. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

Having multiple Sandboxes will not affect program functionality. Have you tried deleting the contents of your Sandbox?<br>
If you provide your configuration file (Sandboxie Control --&gt; Configure---&gt; Edit configuration), we can take a look and see if anything stand out.<br>

Yes, defaultbox sandbox is set to delete automatically once the last program closes.<br>

Without the Office_2016 sandbox, office 2016 refuses to launch. I recreated &amp; deleted  Office_2016 sandbox twice &amp; both time office 2016 stopped working after the second sandbox deletion so I'm pretty sure the existence of second sandbox is somehow making office 2016 work.</div>

<br>
Definitely strange, and I cannot reproduce it. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Without the Office_2016 sandbox, office 2016 refuses to launch.

So, if you create the second Sandbox, you can run Office 2016 under the Default one? <br>
Any chance that the default Sandbox is located anywhere other than C: drive?  <br>
<br>
Last but not least, can you please try the latest Beta and see if that issue follows you there? <br>

				<div class="content">Well, I installed office 2016 again on win 10 pro ( Not N this time ) <br>
<br>
And the same thing It wont launch under sandboxie and "click to run" selected . (sandboxie 5.24) <br>
<br>
The error is " We're sorry , but word has run into an error that is preventing it prom working correctly. Word will need to be closed as a result. Would you like to repair it now ?" <br>
<br>
This is after word is like opening and the "Select a template" page is behind the message . <br>
<br>
My operating system is win 10 pro RS (With fall creators) . I think and not sure (About the RS) . Which means that is a version for developers (I think).</div>

Sandboxie should automatically detect and add templates as needed. To use Office Click-to-run template you need the paid version of Sandboxie. <br>
If you would like me to test and troubleshoot your scenario, I need the info I asked for in my previous response. <br>
