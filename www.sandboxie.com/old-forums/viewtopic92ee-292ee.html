				<div class="content">Many times I need to delete contents of all sandboxes at once. Could be possible to add an option to do so by right clicking the Sandboxie Control just like in the image? Just below the Disable Forced Programs function? It would be very handy.<br>
<br>

<br>
Please note I'm aware of "Automatically delete contents of sandbox" function, but you should know some sandboxes are using it and others don't. I'm planning to create more sandboxes some with "Automatically delete contents of sandbox" function on and others off.<br>
<br>
Another last and obvious request is, if the "Delete All Sandboxes Context at Once" is implemented then the following window must not appear when delete command is invoked although it's still good for each separated sandbox:<br>

Currently I've got 20 sandboxes. Sometimes some of them have contents within but don't know which ones at a certain moment, then when I want to delete contents (to make sure all sandboxes are empty) I have to pass one by one. How to delete contents of all sandboxes simultaneously, in just one click?</div>

The option is available already. If you click Terminate all programs, all programs running in any sandbox are terminated and all sandboxes get deleted except the ones that you have set to "Never remove this sandbox or delete its contents."<br>

Are you sure you want to delete the contents of all of them? Any program that's installed in a sandbox would be gone, even if it's not in use at the time.<br>
<br>
The last time I tried check marking the "Sandboxie" item in CCleaner, it would delete the contents of all sandboxes that are in the default Container Folder location, but not if the sandbox has been relocated using the FileRootPath setting. I didn't like that since I have programs installed inside of sandboxes, so I never check mark that item in CCleaner.</div>

True. Terminate All Programs feature won't delete the contents of all sandboxes at once, besides some of them are NOT set to auto-delete as soon as the programs are terminated.<br>
Yes, I am sure I want to delete all contents of all sandboxes at once. So I need that command/function to be added when right-click. They just need to add a warning message and confirm button so people can't delete anything mistakenly.</div>

				<div class="content">I think the Terminate all programs option is not perfect for what you want to do but I think it works alright. The only sandboxes that don't get deleted are the ones you set not to delete or the ones that you haven't selected anything in Delete invocation. If it was me who wanted an option to delete all sandboxes at once, since in my personal case selecting the option not to delete contents really means that, not deleting the contents of those sandboxes really works perfect. Same with sandboxes where I dont select anything in Delete invocation. But this is me.<br>
<br>
Guest10 mentioned CCleaner. I don't like using CCleaner to delete contents but I leave the Sandboxie setting ticked. I use it as a warning to let me know when I forgot to delete contents of a sandbox. I install programs in sandboxes but I like to delete contents after I finish using the program. Usually I set the sandbox not to delete on closing and after installing and using the program, I remove that setting and delete the sandbox manually. When I forget to delete the sandbox, CCleaners warns me and then I delete it using SBIE. You could use CCleaner to delete contents on all sandboxes but empty folders remain if you do so.<br>

Thanks for your suggestions. Too much hassle for me the use of ccleaner. I'd still like to see this feature as part of Sandboxie when right-click the systray icon, guess is not that much to ask for... <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>

I just thought of something, Mr X. If the feature was available, I wont need CCleaner warning me about a sandbox that I forgot to delete <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">. Thats good.<br>

Exactly, I really haven't see it from your own perspective, I mean the way you use it, so even more reason to implement that feature.</div>

I currently use a RAMDisk which clears the contents of all sandboxes on reboot, but having the option below "Terminate all programs" would be hugely helpful. The feature would still need to check the settings for "Never remove this sandbox or delete its contents" as in that case you could still mark certain sandboxes to not be cleared during the process.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Mr.X,<br>
<br>
I just stumbled across this:<br>
<br>
<a href="../indexfb58.html?StartCommandLine" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/?StartCommandLine</a><br>
<br>
It seems sandboxie has commandline options to stop programs and delete contents of sandboxes. With the commandline arguments you can easily create a batchfile to do what you want. For example If I wanted to create a batchfile to delete the contents of both my IE sandbox and Firefox sandbox I could add the following in notepad and save it as a .bat:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>F:\Apps\Sandboxie\Start.exe /box:SBIExplorer /terminate
F:\Apps\Sandboxie\Start.exe /box:SBIExplorer delete_sandbox

F:\Apps\Sandboxie\Start.exe /box:SBFirefox /terminate
F:\Apps\Sandboxie\Start.exe /box:SBFirefox delete_sandbox
</code></pre></div>

You can obviously add in as many sandboxes as you want.<br>
<br>
I guess with a little extra coding you could create a script that both runs the above and then checks for the existence of your sandboxes after the deletion to ensure they're fully cleared.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.</div>

				<div class="content">Just a further thought on this for anyone else thinking of doing it. I've found quite often I'll get a sandboxie error message complaining it can't delete a file, on investigation the file is always deleted anyway. Due to the messages it's best to suppress errors using delete_sandbox_silent:<br>
<br>
Example:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>F:\Apps\Sandboxie\Start.exe /box:SBSteam /terminate
F:\Apps\Sandboxie\Start.exe /box:SBSteam delete_sandbox_silent
F:\Apps\Sandboxie\Start.exe /box:SBTOR /terminate
F:\Apps\Sandboxie\Start.exe /box:SBTOR delete_sandbox_silent
</code></pre></div>
At the bottom of the batchfile It's worth adding a line like the following:<br>
<br>
Explorer.exe "R:\Sandbox\user"<br>
<br>
The above opens the sandbox folder in explorer after deletion is complete meaning you can immediately see that all sandboxes have been successfully cleared (change path to that of your sandbox folder).</div>
