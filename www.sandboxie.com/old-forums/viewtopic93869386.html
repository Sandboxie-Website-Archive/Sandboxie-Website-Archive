				<div class="content">Sandboxie provides a template for Google Japanese IME, but for a long time a template has been missing for <strong>Google Chinese IME</strong>. Would it be very difficult to add a template? There are many Chinese IMEs but as far as I know Google Pinyin IME and Sogou Pinyin IME are the most popular ones. I suspect the lack of Chinese IME support will automatically put off any potential Chinese customers.<br>
<br>
I've just seen this other thread which is basically the same issue: <a href="viewtopiced9ded9d.html?t=16821" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... hp?t=16821</a>. Since that thread is locked I am posting a new one here to continue to chase this issue.<br>
<br>
The Google Chinese IME can be downloaded here: <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/zh-CN/ime/pinyin/" class="postlink">http://www.google.com/intl/zh-CN/ime/pinyin/</a><br>
Run the installer and, during installation, uncheck all checkboxes to prevent it from sending stats and changing IE's home page.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Needs to be installed <strong>un</strong>sandboxed. The idea is that it should work when typing into sandboxed programs.<br>
<br>
To be able to type Chinese into sandboxed apps would be huge for me and hopefully for other fellow users too. Thanks a lot and keep the good stuff coming!</div>
