				<div class="content">I know this has been brought up before but I thought I'd mention it again because, well, I hate the normal border width of sandboxed programs [but I do like having a border for certain programs]. Being able to select a color is great but I just can't stand the 6 pixel border. [guess I should just add it to my other {pretty much pointless} gui/icon hatreds?] I've done a bit of playing and found that my ideal border width is 3/2 but I also find 4 acceptable (tbh for some reason I couldn't really see a difference on odd number(s)). 6 is just horrible (to me) and anything less was hard to see on any resolution above 1024x768. Either way with the current set up I can't imagine making this a user defined option would be difficult.<br>
<br>
That being said, it's not on my priority list nor should it get on yours but if/when you concern yourselves with the GUI <em>please</em> consider adding an option to let the user select the border width along with the currently available option to set a color in each box. :D<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
For now it seems to be using a 'static' number
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>(SBIECTRL)  5.0.7.1<br>
32bit [XP] - No ASLR<br>
00409A1F mov     [dword ss:ebp-18],6<br>
<br>
64bit Hex location<br>
0xa344</div></blockquote>

of 6 with some type of fallback to 4, though what sets that off, I can't say. As a test run in a VM I changed it a few times and found I like a width of 3, where it is easily visible (but ignorable) yet not annoying/distracting like the current width.<br>
