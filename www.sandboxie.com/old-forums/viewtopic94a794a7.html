				<div class="author">by <strong>famadeus</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Version 5.11.8 onwards seems to have introduced a number of issues for me on Windows 7 x64. None of these issues are present in 5.11.7, everything is working perfectly in that release. I initially went from 5.11.7 -&gt; 5.11.9 and discovered these problems, I downloaded 5.11.8 to test and had the same issues.<br>
<br>
Here's what I've come across so far:<br>
<br>
Issue 1: my usb game controller is not working in sandboxed applictions, no response whatsoever.<br>
<br>
Issue 2: audio switching between headphones and speakers results in muted volume in sandboxed applications. e.g. when playing a game I use my audio manager to switch all audio from my 2.1 speakers to my headphones, in 5.11.7 this works perfectly but in 5.11.8+ it results in silence, I have to restart the application to get audio back.<br>
<br>
Issue 3: No audio when loading a new stream on <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/" class="postlink">http://www.twitch.tv</a> until I refresh once in Firefox 46.</div>

Try beta 5.11.8, remember these are BETAs. The stable version is 5.10.<br>
<br>

Depends on the Game, and if the game understands the SB container. SB simply passes the that on to whatever needs it. However, we do not test game controllers, so it may be the game/application.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>

Again, these are BETA versions. Use a new beta and check the Change Log to see if others were reporting the issue? If not, then you should be using the stable version unless you need a beta.

Hi Craig, thanks for the reply. I'm aware that these are beta versions, I'm just providing feedback as you move towards you next stable release (unless that's not helpful?). As I mentioned in my post I initially experienced these issues when going from 5.11.7 to 5.11.9, I then downloaded 5.11.8 to test and the issues persisted therefore 5.11.8 is the version in which these issues were introduced and they continue to occur in 5.11.9.<br>
<br>
I haven't had the chance to test my controller in a freshly created sandbox but I can tell you that it's happening in three seperate sandboxes running different applications with multiple games, everything works perfectly again with all of them when reverting to 5.11.7.<br>
<br>
Audio switching between headphones and speakers is broken in 5.11.8 and 5.11.9 but again works perfectly in 5.11.7<br>
<br>
The browser audio issue on <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/" class="postlink">http://www.twitch.tv</a> occurs in a fresh sandbox on both 5.11.8 and 5.11.9, no issues in 5.11.7 which I'll continue to use for now.</div>

The latest version of Direct X available on Windows 7 - Direct X 11.1 (KB2670838)<br>
<br>
Realtek HD Audio Manager, which comes bundled with audio drivers/codecs. Again the latest version 2.79.<br>

Just fyi I did a quick test with 5.11.10 and also have the issues on that version.</div>

Direct X 11 is standard. as for that KB, it was addressed long ago..... but there are MS posts about this KB causing sound issues, But then again, it was released in early 2013. We're a long since past that w/ SBIE.<br>
I currently have the standard Windows audio device.High Def Audio device [v6.1.7601.17514]<br>
Twitch works fine in switching, in FF, Cyberfox, etc. <br>
Same applies to Youtube in both.<br>
<br>
Maybe totally uninstall SBIE, not not safe the config .ini file, reboot and reinstall? <br>
<br>
Could it be Realtek? Unsure. But I'm willing to bet others in our 4 million user base have it installed as well. <br>
<br>
Otherwise, no other ideas. I overwrite SBIE many times during the day in testing various browsers/audio players, and with the Standards Direct 11+ and above &amp; Standard Windows High Def Audio Driver, not problems here.</div>

Wow, I'm going to have to throw in my two cents here, and say there needs to be a way to override this behavior.  <br>
<br>
I guess if anything, I'm better off leaving outlook as not being a forced program, and Sandbox it manually... This way, if I do run it without being Sandboxed, chrome will still be forced into a sandbox.</div>

Well, we're not going to use limited resourced on a <strong>Dev build</strong> on a browser we've <strong>never heard of</strong>, nor do we support. Please use a browser we support [Below]<br>
<br>
And you're using a Beta build of SBIE. The Stable build is 5.10. But there is not guarantee "Brave" will work. As I mentioned above. <br>
<br>
It's best to try and install the browser on your HOST and then run it as sandboxed to test, we cannot gurantee forks of the main 4 we support can be directly installed into a SB. Here is a link to ones we've tested installed DIRECTLY into a SB <a href="viewtopic7fa77fa7.html?f=11&amp;t=21974" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 11&amp;t=21974</a><br>
<br>
However, we are at the moment compatible with with many many browsers, however we cannot support every single one. <br>
<br>
We don't support Tor and others. <br>
<br>
<strong>We directly only support IE, Chrome, FF and Opera. 32/64 bit...</strong><br>
<br>
but we also work with [as of June 2016]<br>
<br>
Vivaldi<br>
Cyberfox<br>
Palemoon<br>
SeaMonkey<br>
Slimjet<br>
Chromium<br>
Comodo browser<br>
....YMMV with any these forks...and other forks of Chrome / FF, but again, we directly look at the "big 4" for resources.</div>
