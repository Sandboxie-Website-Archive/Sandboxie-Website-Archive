				<h3>Lastpass extension crashes in Chrome</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Tue Apr 24, 2018 6:32 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>kydar</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I run Chrome inside Sandboxie (paid version) and everything usually runs fine.  Lately though the Lastpass extension crashes occasionally and cannot be reloaded.  It will be running fine, when all of a sudden it becomes disabled, and looking at it on the extension manager page shows that it "may have been corrupted."  At that point, if I uninstall it (i.e., the lastpass extension) and attempt to reinstall it, I get a "could not unzip extension" error in Chrome.  The only solution is to delete the entire sandbox and create a new one.  This has happened 3-4 times in the past couple months.<br>
<br>
None of this happens when I run Chrome outside the sandbox, so Sandboxie would seem to be the culprit somehow.  Would appreciate any help or feedback.<br>
<br>
Win 7 ultimate<br>
Chrome 65.0.3325.181<br>
Sandboxie 5.25.1 (same happened in 5.24, thought the beta might fix it)<br>
Lastpass 4.9.1</div>

Do you  mean that if you delete the contents of your Sandbox, the issue persists after relaunching Chrome? <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> At that point, if I uninstall it ...</div></blockquote>
If the application is installed on the host, then you would need to re-install it outside Sandboxie, then delete the contents of your Sandbox and re-try.  <br>
<br>
When it crashes, what happens exactly? Are there any error messages? <br>
Are you using any other extensions as well? <br>
Can you repro the crash by performing any specific actions?<br>
Is the LastPass template enabled ? (Right-Click on your Sandbox --&gt; Sandbox settings ---&gt; Applications ---&gt;Security/Privacy --&gt; LastPass<br>
<br>
What is your OS architecture? x64? x86?<br>
<br>
Also, please post your Sandboxie configuration file:<br>
Configure--&gt;  Edit configuration<br>
Copy-paste the output here<br>
Highlight the output you just pasted and click on the "&lt;/&gt;" button for format it. <br>
<br>

It will recur, yes, but not immediately.  As I mentioned, it has happened about 3-4 times in the past month.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> If the application is installed on the host, then you would need to re-install it outside Sandboxie, then delete the contents of your Sandbox and re-try.</div></blockquote>
I see.  I was reinstalling the browser extension in Chrome within the sandbox.  I guess you're saying that's a no-no.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>When it crashes, what happens exactly? Are there any error messages? </div></blockquote>
The extension icon disappears, and if I then look in Chrome's More tools/extensions area, I see the extension listed as "may be corrupted" or something of that nature.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Are you using any other extensions as well? </div></blockquote>
Oh yes I use many extensions in Chrome.  Lastpass is the only one that has this problem though.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Can you repro the crash by performing any specific actions?</div></blockquote>
Not that I've been able to determine as of yet.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Is the LastPass template enabled ? (Right-Click on your Sandbox --&gt; Sandbox settings ---&gt; Applications ---&gt;Security/Privacy --&gt; LastPass</div></blockquote>
There are two hyphens between the brackets.  I'm not sure if that means it is enabled or not<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>What is your OS architecture? x64? x86?</div></blockquote>
x64<br>
<br>
Also, please post your Sandboxie configuration file:<br>

				<div class="content">Hello kydar,<br>
<br>
So far, I have not been able to reproduce the issue. I am going to leave Chrome + LastPass + Sbie running for a while and will update this thread if anything comes up. <br>
<br>
Please let me know the results after having re-installed the application outside Sandboxie and testing in a new Sandbox with default settings. <br>
The two hyphens in the LastPass template indicate it is enabled globally (which is what we want, so all good there). <br>
<br>
What are the other extensions installed? Try removing them one at a time to see if the behavior changes.<br>
<br>
I also see you have an AV running, make sure Sandboxie is whitelisted and also test disabling/removing the AV to see if the behavior changes.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>
