				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
A bit of a strange request, but is it possible to remove all the dotted lines when you select entries in the main GUI? It's so ugly.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":|" title="Neutral"> <br>

I think you're misunderstanding, this hasn't got anything to do with third party apps, it's something that should be fixed in SBIE's GUI. The example that I gave is about how it should look. The main flaw lies in Windows itself, for some reason some idiot decided that you should see dotted lines when selecting something, but if programmed correctly, you won't see this. And I'm talking about the main GUI, see screenshot, if you click on any of the sandboxes (either left or right-click) there should be no dotted lines. In the screenshot I haven't selected anything, because I hate the dotted lines so much.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":x" title="Mad"> <br>

Yes I understand, but I'm sure it's easy to fix, so why not. It's indeed a Windows problem, but developers can fix it in their own apps. Even Windows 10 suffers from this problem. Another request: make SBIE remember column-size: Program Name, PID, Window Title.</div>

... Yes, our Devs are fixing the product. Making sbie play nice with many versions of Windows, browsers, office suites and a whole host of programs. Those are the priorities, and will always be. As they change...daily.</div>

Correct, we need to move more closely to a perfect world. Of course this isn't about usability, but about esthetics. I am what I call a GUI geek, the GUI has to be absolutely perfect. I do get your point, but if it's easy to fix, I hope it will be gone soon. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>
