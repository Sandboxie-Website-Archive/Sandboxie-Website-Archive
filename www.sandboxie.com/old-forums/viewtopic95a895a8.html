Ok by me if only one may be active at any one time.<br>
<br>
Ok (but a bit of a nuisance) if the different versions need to be run under different users.<br>

Thanks</div>

<br>
What are you trying to do, exactly?<br>
You could use VMWare to install different versions of Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
Regarding Sandboxie 3.76, it is very outdated and will not work on current OS installations :<br>

I want to use a current version for normal sandbox work - browsing, etc. But I also want to be able to fire up 3.76 so that I can use BSA with it. I didn't want to stir up that unhappy history so I didn't mention it in my first post. Sure, I could run a copy of XP in VirtualBox, then SBIE 3.76 in that, and so on, but I was hoping that I could have both versions available straight at my desktop (not at the same time, necessarily).<br>
<br>
I had gotten the impression from the million-or-more (maybe not, my eyes started to glaze over by the end) posts that I read yesterday that 3.76 did work on W7.<br>
