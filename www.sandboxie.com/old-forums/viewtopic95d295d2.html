				<div class="content">I have a question about Forced Programs.<br>
<br>
What happens if I have the same forced program registered in more than one sandbox and, say, I start it not in any one of those sandboxes, but using instead (unsandboxed) Windows Explorer or from the Start Menu? Assuming that Sandboxie would trap the program invocation, which sandbox would prevail, for example concerning Internet access restrictions for the program concerned?</div>

<br>
The program will run in the first Sandbox that it is forced to start in.<br>
You can test it if you have the paid version. Just set a program to forced in multiple Sandboxes and you'll see the behavior.<br>
<br>
Please find more info here:<br>

				<div class="content">Thanks Barb.<br>
Forgive me if I didn't fully understand the explanation.<br>
Taking as an example the information in the link that you mentioned:<br>
<br>
   [DefaultBox]<br>
   ForceProcess=iexplore.exe<br>
   ForceProcess=firefox.exe<br>
   [MailBox]<br>
   ForceProcess=outlook.exe<br>
   <strong><span style="color: #FF0000">ForceProcess=firefox.exe</span></strong><br>
<br>
What would happen in the above situation? If Firefox were to be started unsandboxed, would it run as a forced process in the DefaultBox or in the MailBox sandbox?</div>

Hi cocoon, the proper thing to do would be to leave Firefox as a Forced program in your DefaultBox, and take it off from the Mailbox.<br>
<br>
By doing so, if you click a link in an email and Firefox is your default browser, Firefox will run sandboxed in your Mailbox (as long as outlook.exe is forced, as you have it now).<br>
<br>
If you run Firefox in any other way, it would be forced to run sandboxed in your DefaultBox.<br>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the comment. So if I understand correctly according to that example, if program X is invoked by a sandboxed program Y, then X will run sandboxed in Y's sandbox. Else, if X is a Forced Program in a sandbox, it will run sandboxed if invoked either specifically from its sandbox or by any other means.</div>
