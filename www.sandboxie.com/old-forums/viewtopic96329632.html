I will no longer be recommending sandboxie due to the licencing change.<br>

I have been placing the free version on computers I build for clients.  I know many of them have upgraded to the full version.<br>
<br>
I would understand a lifetime license with an upgrade cost for version upgrades, say 1/2 the price of a new purchase.  That way people can decide if they need the features of the new version.  <br>
<br>
Using a subscription model for a stand-alone program, this is called greed.  This is not a program that requires frequent upgrades, ie virus scanner.  I thought M$ was greedy with there licencing, you are way beyond them.<br>

I hope many others feel the same and refuse to buy your product.  Would serve you right to go out of business.<br>

Hmm.  Do you work for free for you clients.   Look at at all the work that went into getting sandboxie to function with Win 8 and Win 8.1.   Given all the people on lifetime licenses, that has been a huge amount of work that he got nothing for.  Bet you wouldn't do that.   I would call not wanting him to be paid for that greed.<br>
<br>
Bye.</div>

Uhm, indeed. SBIE is a whole lot <strong>more </strong>effective than a virus scanner.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> Meanwhile, disregarding all the new features and improvements, tzuk has 6 more OS versions to make his code compatible with (W8 x86/x64, W8.1 x86/x64, W2012, W2012R2), plus all those constant third-party application updates that require compatibility fixes.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Would serve you right to go out of business. </div></blockquote>

In case you are working for free for your clients, it's not much of a business any more... Hope you don't dare to be greedy and charge them.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> <br>

				<div class="content">I have read responses to the licencing change on these forums and on others, most are not positive.<br>
<br>
I understand why the change was implemented.  I am a developer myself, I know the work involved with maintaining and upgrading an application.  I have nothing against charging for the work.  I just don't agree with renting software.<br>
<br>
I could have been more eloquent in my bashing, there are many such responses already on the forum.  I was blunt and a bit over the top, it was intentional.  I am sure many people feel the same way, but haven't posted.<br>
<br>
It is a great product, I have purchased it for friends and family members in the past and will continue using it.<br>
<br>
I just felt that the developer should know the response to his change.  I didn't have anything to add, other responses covered my points in more detail.  I wrote to inform the developer of the sentiments the change brings about in an average user. I wrote for the silent majority.</div>

<br>
tmanning, you can have installing free versions, not payed lifetime versions to your clients for how long as you may please or not. It is your choice !<br>
The free version has the same capabilities as always.</div>

If Tzuk, asked for some donations, to further support him, I'd bet many would support him.   I know some have already offered.</div>

How is that being hypocritical?  A lifetime license holder buying additional yearly licenses doesn't make sense, unless you're talking about buying them as gifts to give away with the money going towards further development.  We bought lifetime licenses during the time when they were offered and receive the benefit of them.  Whatever type of license one buys, that purchase funds further development.<br>
<br>
I've used Sandboxie for a few years now, but if I had just recently heard of it and then found out that I missed out on a lifetime by a few months, I'd still buy the 1 year license because the program is that good.  It's less than $2/month, big deal.  People waste a lot more money than that on nonsense they don't even need or remember a few months later.</div>

There is many kind of software that would not be flagged as malicious by an AV. It will make some sort of registry imprint if you install them in your Windows as a try and then later regret, oh wish I had not done that.<br>
SBIE helps so you don't have to install them to try and regret later about how to uninstall all crap.<br>
<br>
These days AVs are offered just good as free if you guys/girls are a bit  short of money like me. To pay for your security something like 1.5€ a month, is as was told cheap and supporting Ronen's work a bit. Can't imagine how hard work he is doing to put up with latest MS systems and all the requests it brings to him.</div>

It's hypocritical if the people who own lifetime licences have a go at the people posting about their dislike of the new subscription/renting model, telling them to stop whining and that Tzuk shouldn't have to work for nothing, blah, blah, blah.<br>
<br>
An example, given the new licencing model... an old lifetime licence is roughly equivalent in price to a new two year subscription. Therefore, anyone with a lifetime licence has essentially paid for two years of further development (from the time of purchase). After that, they are not funding further development, and so are hypocrites if they tell other people that Tzuk shouldn't work for nothing, and yet don't contribute further to the development by purchasing a subscription once a year, for each lifetime licence.<br>
<br>
Anyone who has a lifetime licence is obviously entitled to lifetime free upgrades, without further purchase, but you are a hypocrite if you have a go at other people and tell them to purchase a subscription as Tzuk shouldn't work for nothing (which essentially funds new features for the hypocrites as well).</div>

				<div class="content">Several of us, myself included, have contacted Tzuk in the past about making contributions / donations...which he politely declined to accept.  So much for the "greed" some are so anxious to label him with.<br>
<br>
The fact remains that since lifetime licenses are now a thing of the past, current and future users will have to evaluate the program on its merits and decide for themselves whether the software is worth the small annual investment or else opt to use the free version or none at all.<br>
<br>
There's no use in lamenting the past and lambasting the developer who has brought a superior product to market and deserves to be compensated. <br>
(And yet still makes a fully functional version available at no charge.)</div>
