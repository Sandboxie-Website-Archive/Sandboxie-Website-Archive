				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>famadeus wrote:</cite>Version 5.11.8 onwards seems to have introduced a number of issues for me on Windows 7 x64. None of these issues are present in 5.11.7, everything is working perfectly in that release. I initially went from 5.11.7 -&gt; 5.11.9 and discovered these problems, I downloaded 5.11.8 to test and had the same issues.<br>
<br>
Here's what I've come across so far:<br>
<br>
Issue 1: my usb game controller is not working in sandboxed applictions, no response whatsoever.<br>
<br>
Issue 2: audio switching between headphones and speakers results in muted volume in sandboxed applications. e.g. when playing a game I use my audio manager to switch all audio from my 2.1 speakers to my headphones, in 5.11.7 this works perfectly but in 5.11.8+ it results in silence, I have to restart the application to get audio back.<br>
<br>
Issue 3: No audio when loading a new stream on <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/" class="postlink">http://www.twitch.tv</a> until I refresh once in Firefox 46.</div></blockquote>
See if this is fixed in 5.11.11.</div>

Well, this doesn't tell us anything other than you're getting an error. Please follow the instructions in the post here to give us what we need to try and help.. <a href="viewtopic633b633b.html?f=11&amp;t=19746" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 11&amp;t=19746</a><br>
<br>
If 5.10 didn't have the error, roll back to that until you can give us the info</div>

SBIE1408 message only appears after installation, after restart computer the service (SbieSvc) and sandboxie are working properly. Installation was carried out twice with complete removal and restart, and always had a message SBIE1408. The system has two users, one administrator, the other basic user with standard rights. The system is low on software (used portable), without viruses, registry cleaners are not used. After a clean install of windows 10 program was used O&amp;O ShutUp10.<br>
<br>
After installation win 10, use the script in AVZ<br>
<br>
begin<br>
RegKeyIntParamWrite('HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE', 'SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server','fAllowToGetHelp', 0);<br>
RegKeyIntParamWrite('HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE', 'SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA','RestrictAnonymous', 2);<br>
RegKeyIntParamWrite('HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE', 'System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters','AutoShareWks', 0);<br>
SetServiceStart('RDSessMgr', 4);<br>
SetServiceStart('mnmsrvc', 4);<br>
SetServiceStart('TermService', 4);<br>
SetServiceStart('RemoteRegistry', 4);<br>
RebootWindows(true);<br>
end.<br>
<br>
Antivirus: ESET Smart Security 9.0.381.1 and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware 2.2.1.1043 (It does not work in real time).<br>
<br>
Installed libraries:<br>
Microsoft XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0.20823.0<br>

				<div class="content">What are these scripts? I'm assuming SBIE works just fine until these are run..and why are they run?<br>
<br>
You also have 3rd party security. It's unknown what impact those may have. They have not been tested recently. So, They would need to be considered as well.<br>
<br>
Are you running a portable version of SBIE?</div>

Just fyi I did a quick test with 5.11.10 and also have the issues on that version.</div></blockquote>

Direct X 11 is standard. as for that KB, it was addressed long ago..... but there are MS posts about this KB causing sound issues, But then again, it was released in early 2013. We're a long since past that w/ SBIE.<br>
I currently have the standard Windows audio device.High Def Audio device [v6.1.7601.17514]<br>
Twitch works fine in switching, in FF, Cyberfox, etc. <br>
Same applies to Youtube in both.<br>
<br>
Maybe totally uninstall SBIE, not not safe the config .ini file, reboot and reinstall? <br>
<br>
Could it be Realtek? Unsure. But I'm willing to bet others in our 4 million user base have it installed as well. <br>
<br>
Otherwise, no other ideas. I overwrite SBIE many times during the day in testing various browsers/audio players, and with the Standards Direct 11+ and above &amp; Standard Windows High Def Audio Driver, not problems here.</div></blockquote>

I'm happy to report all of the issues are gone in the 5.12 final.</div>

This usually means SbieSvc is not running. You can look in the Windows system event log for a possible error msg, but if it works fine after a reboot, then don't worry about it.</div>
