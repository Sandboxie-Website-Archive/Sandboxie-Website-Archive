I would like the download, at all times, to be within SBIE environment. It would download<br>
into SBIE then I would execute it from within SBIE environment ideally.<br>
<br>
Example, I don't want this scenario: download to SBIE, Recover to Windows 8.1 downloads<br>
folder (from SBIE), then Open download with SBIE from within Windows download folder<br>
Instead I'm after: download to SBIE, Open file within SBIE, Delete Contents with SBIE (when finished)</div></blockquote>
I think just removing Downloads from Quick Recovery will accomplish this.</div></blockquote>
By 'removing' you mean click 'recover contents' ?</div>

None.  The folder containing newly introduced files (eg. downloaded files) is in principle never opened with a REAL explorer window.  Selected files that I want to keep are taken out of the sandbox via cut/paste commands (may be as simple as using a keyboard or mouse to achieve this).<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>sanbox man wrote:</cite>Virus Total is owned by Google - can they be trusted with privacy of files they scan I wonder?</div></blockquote>

If you're concerned, then don't use VirusTotal.  Or only use it for files that aren't sensitive.</div>

In short, SBIE likely does exactly what you want already but it isn't 'User Proof'. Even if you define paths that are 'unprotected' so far as file changes there is no escaping [that I know of] a sandbox once a program is in it. This includes anything else this program launches/opens while it's inside [for that session].

While I'm one of those weird people that thinks transferring control of programs between boxes if rules are defined for both would be great I understand that it wouldn't be the easiest thing to pull off so I'm content with the way things are. Once in, always in! (TrademarkedÂ¿)</div></blockquote>

Q1: The 'folder' you are referring to is sitting within a SBIE environment or outside SBIE environment at this point?<br>

Unfortunately I can't really clarify any further, as I've already detailed to the best of my ability in those links I gave earlier in this thread.  I even did video demonstrations of the principle.  So I'd suggest that you carefully go through all those links and threads.  All the best.</div>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Like I said, this ones likely <strong>not</strong> the one you want as it allows the changes (downloads) to be saved outside the sandbox</span>.<br>
<br>
Sandbox Settings &gt; Resource Access &gt; File Access &gt; Direct Access then adding the download folder will allow the downloads to be saved to the 'real path' aka outside of sandboxie.<br>
Then by adding the same path to Forced Folders <em>(paid only)</em> any program you run from that directory [with an unsandboxed explorer] would also be forced into the sandbox.<br>
Sandbox Settings &gt; Program Start &gt; Forced Folders<br>
<br>
Keep in mind though that <em>without doing any of the above</em> you can already use the 'sandboxed browser' and attempt to run/open whatever you download and it will be opened in the same sandbox that the sandboxed browser is currently running in. Eg, it already seems to do what you want.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>sanbox man wrote:</cite>
Where can I learn more about 'defining paths' methods for SBIE? Where can I learn more about 'Defining Rules' for SBIE?</div></blockquote>

Most of the path options are available within Sandbox Settings &gt; Resource Access<br>
<br>
The FAQ is a good place to read about a majority of the Sandbox Settings though there may be some out of date info left over. <a href="../indexb081.html?SandboxSettings" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?SandboxSettings</a><br>
As for which rules you should define, that'll be something you'll want to decide for yourself as every setup is different and every user wants different things.</div>

I used Files and Folders method outlined by you above.<br>
I downloaded a 2.5kb zip file:<br>
"what should firefox do with this file?" was asked<br>
I selected Open With Windows Explorer (default)<br>
and clicked ok then I got:<br>
'Message from Sandboxie' box saying<br>
SBIE2101 object name not found: error Open Process (C0000022) access=001FFFFF initialized=1<br>
Help (was flashing)<br>
Copy to contents to Clipboard (underneath)<br>
<br>
How do I use the method you outlined to open keep this zip <br>
inside sbie and also run it from there? Tried looking for the zip in files and floders no where to be found.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi sanbox man,<br>
<br>
What program do you use to run zip files on your computer? <br>
If you are getting errors, try deleting the contents of your Sandbox (or create a new one) and give it another go.  Let us know if that works.<br>
<br>
As for your questions, if you want to open downloaded files within Sandboxie all you have to do is download a file via a Sandboxed browser and either Open it (instead of selecting download), or download it but do not recover it (once you recovered it, it will be on your host). <br>
<br>
For the zip file that you downloaded, based on whether you recovered it or not you will find it under your download folder, or inside the Sandbox.<br>
Here's how you can navigate the Sandbox's files and folders: <br>

1. I suggest at first using that method try testing downloading something simple, like a picture. That way you ll get a good feel of how it works.<br>
<br>
2. In my view, what you want to do is so inconvenient I never use that method for nothing.<br>
<br>
And 3. Sandbox man, get yourself a license so you can get files that you download to run sandboxed automatically when they are executed. Its safer and takes away all the inconvenience that you putting yourself thru.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>
