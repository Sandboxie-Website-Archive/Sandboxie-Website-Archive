If I the keep XP as my main OS and install Ubuntu as an alternative OS to select as required, can I then use Sandboxie with Ubuntu  without having any problems?</div>

If XP is my main OS, then I start as normal and the XP desktop screen appears. On this screen is an Ubuntu icon. If i click it, up comes the Ubuntu desktop screen On that screen is a Sandboxie icon, one of many, which if configured correctly allows me to open my Ubuntu browser (Opera) sandboxed like any other program and just like it does on XP.<br>
<br>
What is wrong with that ?</div>

Sandboxie is not compatible with Linux OS.<br>
<br>
There was a claim by Wine that would allow Sandboxie to be emulated in Linux. It does not work. As SBIE needs to install a driver and that cannot be done in Wine (much like SBIE.) I've spoke to their Dev and have confirmed this. <br>
<br>
Sandboxie is Windows Only. Unless you're in a VM...then you can load Win in Linux..i.e Virtual box or using Boot camp on a Mac. You can also just run Ubuntu Live. Either USB / CD. But again, SBIE will only work when installed on a Windows based kernel.</div>

Thank you, Your comments confirm what many web discussions say - Sandboxie <strong>is not</strong> for Ubuntu and an alternative like Virtualbox will have to be used. I have my answer.</div>
