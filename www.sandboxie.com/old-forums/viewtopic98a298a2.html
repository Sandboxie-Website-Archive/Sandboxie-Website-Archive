				<h3>I'm back - with a problem with 2.80</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Mon Mar 19, 2007 5:17 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>SBIE User</strong></div>
				<div class="content">After a long absence from the forum, I'm back and just downloaded 2.80.<br>
<br>
I immediately discovered a problem with a very useful Mozilla extension that I use with both Firefox and Thunderbird as Sandboxie-forced programs, and I'm hoping someone can help.<br>
<br>
The extension is Minimize to Tray ( <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2110" class="postlink">https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2110</a> ), Version 0.0.1.2006102615+, released on Oct 26, 2006.  That very useful extension allows one to minimize Mozilla programs to the Windows tray instead of to the programs bar.<br>
<br>
Since I like to keep my email client, Thunderbird, open all the time but minimized to the tray, this is almost a critical extension for me and makes the new version of Sandboxie much less helpful.  This problem did not occur with 2.64 or any prior verison of SBIE -- but I have not tried any more recent versions between 2.64 and 2.80, so I cannot say when the problem began in the current branch of SBIE.<br>
<br>
The problem behavior is that my processor usage shoots up to nearly 100% whenever either Firefox and/or Thunderbird is minimized to the tray using that extension.  If I restore the minimized Firefox and Thunderbird, the processor usage instantly returns to normal.<br>
<br>
I have tried running both Thunderbird and Firefox outside Sandboxie, and the problem does not occur except when the programs are sandboxed -- so I believe this is a problem created by some code in the new branch of Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
Any help will be appreciated.  Temporarily I have uninstalled the Minimize to Tray extension in both Thunderbird and Firefox, but I hope that does not have to be a permanent workaround.<br>
<br>
SBIE (still Happy) User</div>

I'll look into it.<br>
<br>
There are already a few other problems reported for version 2.80.<br>
<br>
Until I release the next version, perhaps you'd like to consider the recently-mentioned <a href="http://en.softonic.com/ie/32372/TrayIt" class="postlink">TrayIt!</a> program.</div>

Anyways, i hope we can get SB to the point where minimize to tray works successfully, for now, we wait <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused">, now dont ya go running off again, ya hear <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>

Thanks.  TrayIt looks great.  I just downloaded it and am using it with no problem.<br>
<br>
I hope you can look into the other problem with the Mozilla extension when you get a chance, but TrayIt provides an excellent alternative -- and it's a portable, no-install application!</div>

Thanks, SnDPhoenix.  Since I've just upgraded from 2.64 to 2.80, it will be a while before I can make a real contribution.  But I'm going to get involved again and will try to help out whenever I can.<br>
<br>
For now I'm afraid I'll have to be more of a requester than than a helper!<br>
<br>
Thanks for verifying the minimize problem with the Mozilla extension.  I have a relatively new box (6 months) with a fast processor and 1gig ram running under XP SP-2, so I'm not sure why my problem was worse than yours.  At least you've confirmed there is some issue with this extension.<br>
<br>
In the meantime I'm using TrayIt based on Tzuk's recommendation.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the shout.  More later . . .</div>

				<div class="content">Usually this 100%/50% thing indicates that two CPUs, or perhaps HyperThreading, are in use.<br>
<br>
One CPU is maxed out at 100%, but from the point of view of the entire system, only 50% of the total processor power is being used.</div>

Back at ya, mizzmona!  I thought you might have left too, since I hadn't seen you for a while before I left.<br>
<br>
OK, now we can get the old gang back together.  I'm looking forward to getting back to this forum -- but I've got a lot of catching up to do with the changes in the new branch of SBIE.<br>
