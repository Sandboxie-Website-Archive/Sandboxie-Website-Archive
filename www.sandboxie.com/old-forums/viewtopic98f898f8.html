				<div class="content">I have Sandboxie 5.20 (64-bit) on Windows 10.  The Sandboxie icon has a yellow background.  When Sandboxie is being used, the icon has red dots in it.  However, when I close applications that use Sandboxie, the red dots disappear.  I've used Sandboxie on WinXP for years &amp; always thought the red dots stay there to show that the Sandbox isn't empty.  i.e. they only disappear after you delete everything in the sandbox.<br>
<br>
Is there some setting that I'm missing on Sandboxie 5.20 or has that behavior (the red dots meaning the sandbox isn't empty) changed?<br>
<br>
Thank you in advance,<br>
Phil</div>

				<div class="content">Hi phrab, the dots and the red X works the same now as years ago.<br>
<br>
When you see red dots in the Sandboxie icon, it means programs are running in the sandbox. If you dont see them, it means there are no programs running in the sandbox.<br>
<br>
When you see a Red X, it means the sandbox contents are being deleted. Deleting the sandbox can be done mannually or set to be done automatically.<br>
<br>
In the example you give, it appears to me that you are using a sandbox thats not set to delete on closing of the sandboxed program. So, when you close the application, programs running in the sandbox are terminated (disappearing red dots) but the sandbox contents are not deleted but are being saved (no Red X).<br>

				<div class="content">Thank you.  I must have forgotten to wake my brain this morning.  I don't know why I forgot that the red dots mean that an application is active &amp; not that the sandbox is empty, but you are so right.</div>
