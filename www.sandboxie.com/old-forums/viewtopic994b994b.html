				<div class="content">It has been a while since I really visited and/or read every line of the home page. Normally, it's just to hit <span style="text-decoration: underline">Click here to download it</span> for release versions...<br>
I must say that after doing a bit of reading anyway while sipping my beer(s) tonight I see room for a couple of <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">much needed</span></em></strong> improvements.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> Data Protection<br>
<br>
Sandboxie restricts and blocks internet websites and programs from accessing your personal data (i.e. My Documents), files &amp; folders on your system </div></blockquote>
It *<strong>CAN</strong>* do that generically or by exe, but by default it <span style="text-decoration: underline">does not</span> prevent <em>access</em> to (reading) anything, including My Documents [Unless I missed something and reading isn't a form of access now¿]. Oh and how exactly are we supposed to use Sandboxie to allow only certain <span style="text-decoration: underline">websites </span>access to specific locations on the computer? I must have missed that memo... /cough<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">To put it shortly: It doesn't sift via websites at all, but it <em><span style="text-decoration: underline">can</span></em> sort by program exe's (which need to be defined manually). [yet still not dlls or even hashes]</span> meaning that all some code needs to do is copy the name of the initial entry point. eg, if firefox is the primary program running, we copy that (via some loaded dll) and create the new process with the same .exe name eg firefox.exe. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> Application Testing<br>
<br>
Safely test and try new programs and applications within Sandboxie and prevent unauthorized changes to your underlying system that may occur </div></blockquote>
Here we are with something that likley equates to the <em>layman/new user</em> as - "If you test it" (said program) inside Sandboxie and it doesn't do anything bad in the sandbox then it might actually be safe. (ignoring the oft shared advice that sandboxie isn't undetectable and a program might behave differently inside!)<br>
<br>
Quite a few posts I've lol'd at (or straight up ignored) personally from new users suddenly make quite a bit more sense. =( /me is not happy atm<br>
<br>
Sure they both make a decent amount of sense <em>from a marketing perspective</em> but I'll be darned if I don't think they are simply <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">wrong</span></strong>, at least phrased as they currently exist, atm.</div>

<br>
Thanks for your feedback. <br>
<br>
I am thinking about making the following changes to Data Protection, what are your thoughts? :<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sandboxie <strong>prevents</strong> internet websites and programs from <strong>modifying</strong> your personal data (i.e. My Documents), files &amp; folders on your system</div></blockquote>

(Websites do store things on your computer, such as cookies, and bookmarks, etc..).<br>
<br>
Regarding Application testing, I understand what you are saying, but we are not telling users to move those programs to their host after running them inside Sandboxie. We are informing them that Sandboxie allows you to test programs inside the Sandbox without affecting your host.  <br>
What users do after that is really outside of the scope of Sandboxie. <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>

Those minor changes would certainly satisfy me on that one!<br>
<br>
Oddly enough it would also sound a tad hollow that way. As if it could still be expanded upon to describe the power that actually exists - yet without overcrowding the area. The exact wording that would resolve this escapes me, atm. Perhaps something a bit more akin to:
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>By default Sandboxie <strong>prevents</strong> internet websites and programs from <strong>modifying</strong> the personal data (i.e. My Documents), files &amp; folders on your system yet leaves <span style="text-decoration: underline">you</span> capable of applying greater control via customized rules helpful for privacy, security or even compatibility.</div></blockquote>
I'm quite certain that suggestion isn't the best ~ but perhaps you will at least see where my mind is at?</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Syrinx,<br>
<br>
Thanks again for your feedback.<br>
<br>
I decided to go with :
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sandboxie <strong>prevents</strong> internet websites and programs from <strong>modifying</strong> your personal data (i.e. My Documents), files &amp; folders on your system</div></blockquote>

The purpose of these statements is to inform users about what can be done with Sandboxie. We do not want to make it so that potential users think they need to customize Sandboxie before being able to use it (makes sense?). <br>
<br>
Hope this satisfies a bit, and do let me know if you have any other ideas. <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>
