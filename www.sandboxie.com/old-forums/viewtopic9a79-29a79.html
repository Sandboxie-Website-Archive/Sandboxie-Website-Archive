				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
The following website is of Macro-ToolWorks automation program <a href="http://macrotoolworks.com/products/macro-toolworks" class="postlink">http://macrotoolworks.com/products/macro-toolworks</a>.<br>
<br>
I emailed Macro-ToolWorks and asked why i cant use Macro-ToolWorks functions to work with Sandboxie and they said it is Sandboxie which can allow Macro-ToolWorks to work with it by probably way of adding Macro-ToolWorks in a white-list of Sandboxie. Thus so that Sandboxie allows Macro-ToolWorks to work with it.<br>
<br>
As it stands i try and use key functions from the Macro-ToolWorks such as tab whilst on sanboxie but when looking back at the Macro-ToolWorks script there is no functions "Tab" ever used. Tab is one example and basically none of the functions work with Sandboxie when this third party software Macro-ToolWorks tries to work with it.<br>
<br>
Is there a way this can be done.</div>

If you provide your OS, antivirus and Sandboxie versions, I will test it.<br>
<br>
Also, what are the exact steps to reproduce the problem? <br>
<br>

				<div class="content">Hi Barb,<br>
<br>
Thanks for replying.<br>
<br>
OS Windows 10<br>
<br>
Sandboxie Version 5.18 (64bit)<br>
<br>
I spoke with Macro-ToolWorks Pro and they said that Sandboxie may have a white list. I am sure that means an exception list so as to list Macro-ToolWorks Pro to work with it.<br>
<br>
I have since managed a workaround where however i have to not have in this example a browser open within Sandboxie but open outside it and therefore the Macro-ToolWorks Pro will work in terms of me making the macro program and thus now i have the program functioning i then open the browser in sandboxie and then when running the macro it works whilst browser in sandboie.<br>
<br>
The annoyance is that when having to tweek the macro program which is quite a job i have to always have the browser out of sandboxie and then when i feel i have made progress to the macro i then have to try the macro out whilst the browser is in sandboie.<br>
<br>
Anything running in Sandboxie will not allow Macro-ToolWorks Pro to work alongside with it unless as i explained above. Meaning when you want to use keyboard keys such as alt ctrl etc. the Macro-ToolWorks Pro did not write it whilst recording the macro.</div>

I downloaded the application but there are way too many options and combinations to try. <br>
Please provide clear steps to reproduce the problem so that I can test it.<br>
<br>
I did try recording a macro from a Sandboxed browser, and it did record the steps (entering a URL and opening a new tab). <br>
<br>
Also,keep in mind that global hot keys will not work with Sandboxie (in case you are running the macro tool inside Sbie).<br>
<br>

<br>
Ok do this, record a macro in the following way.<br>
<br>
1. begin recording macro<br>
2. with the mouse right click browser firefox and point to sandboxie and now that firefox is running in sandboxie continue below to number 3.<br>
3. navigate to options in firefox<br>
4. now use the Tab key on your keyboard several times about 5 times<br>
5. Now stop the recording<br>
6. check the macro program script and you should NOT see the several Tabs listed in the script. if you do see the Tabs listed then i don't know why i cant.<br>
<br>
The only way i would see the several Tabs in the script is if i recorded firefox without it running in sandboxie.</div>

<br>
I do see all the Tabs listed. I am running Macro Toolworks outside Sandboxie and Firefox Sandboxed. <br>
<br>
Is Tab triggering anything in Firefox ?  <br>
When I hit tab repeatedly, I can cycle thru items in the program (search bar, webpage options, etc etc). Does that work for you? <br>
<br>
Does the issue follow you to a new Sandbox? <br>
<br>

				<div class="content">Hi Barb,<br>
<br>
Indeed it will circle through as you stated, however i am talking about the finished macro recorded program script and when looking back in the writing of the script, there is no tab keys showing.<br>
<br>
Have a look at the attached image of my setup just before i record. You will note the yellow border around the firefox illustrating running in sandboxie and ready to record with macro recorder.<br>
<br>
Once i start recording i use the tab key repeatedly  to run about in the firefox. Now stop the macro recording and view the recording script. Do you see any tabs showing within the script. I don't.<br>
<br>
The only way i would see tabs in the script is if the firefox was not running in sandbox and hence would be no yellow border when recording. this will be the only way i see tabs in the script.</div>

<br>
I do see the tabs listed in the created macro after recording it. They display as "Key Tab" . <br>
<br>
I think the issue might be related to Firefox 32 bits. Can you confirm the version that you are using?  <br>
And, can you try the 64 bit version and let me know if that one works as expected? <br>
<br>

<br>
I did have the 32bit and now changed to 64bit, it now works with Macro toolworks pro.<br>
<br>
Many thanks</div>
