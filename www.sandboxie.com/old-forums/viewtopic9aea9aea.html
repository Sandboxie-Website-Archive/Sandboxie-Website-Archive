<br>
If you provide the required info, we may be able to better assist you:<br>
<a href="viewtopic633b633b.html?f=11&amp;t=19746" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=19746</a><br>
<br>
Also, please see if the controller is detected via any other applications. It may be that a particular app needs more access in order to run it.  Perhaps you can also post the results of running Res. Acc. Mon while reproducing the issue (maybe we'll see something there as well):<br>
<a href="../ResourceAccessMonitor.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/ResourceAccessMonitor</a><br>
Repro the issue, copy/paste the output here.<br>
Highlight the output, click on the "&lt;/&gt;" button to format it in the forums.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>

<br>
Maybe a reboot fixed it? Anyway when I made this post I ran ePSXe 2.0.5 with my controller plugged in and the inputs would not pick up, when running the emulator outside of sandbox it worked, that's where I stopped trying to troubleshoot, made my conclusion and made the post here.<br>
<br>
After seeing your post today, and going to get that extra bit of info for you, everything just seems to work now... I don't know what to say, guess you can lock this. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>
