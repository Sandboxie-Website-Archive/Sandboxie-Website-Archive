				<div class="content">Could a sandbox contents be moved to the system Recycle Bin when deleted?<br>
<br>
A couple of times I thought about recovering mis-deleted files but installing any Undelete utility (with 35%+ of success) was too much.

Thank you.</div>

				<div class="content">I have a couple of other suggestions.<br>
<br>
1.  You don't have to automatically delete the sandbox, if this is giving you a hard time.  You might do better with manually deleting the sandbox once every couple of days after you're sure you got everything out.<br>
<br>
But you should not use the same sandbox for months or even weeks without deleting it.<br>
<br>
2.  Or, keep the automatic deletion, but change the delete command (in Sandbox Settings &gt; Delete &gt; Command) to<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>ECHO "%SANDBOX%"</code></pre></div>

Which will just rename your sandbox folder to something like __Delete_DefaultBox_01234567890 but will not delete it.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Tzuk.<br>
As always you're in time and with no empty hands))<br>
<br>
How can one modify the command to delete (<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>correctly</strong> move</span>) contents right into the system Recycle Bin? Quite possibly that many other users prefer recovering something useful after an accident via the traditional routine.<br>
<br>
The only thing to bear in mind is that the system will manually try recovering the deleted file(s) to the initial destination and I don't know for sure how SBIE will take it.<br>
ATM prompt command as <div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>move /Y c:\dosbox\localhost\*.* c:\Recycler\</code></pre></div> is not working properly. So I move it to %temp% instead.<br>
<br>
@surfer<br>
1/2GB??? What a waste. Hope you're going unlimited.<br>
For presumably useful downloads you'd rather <strong>direct-access</strong> or <strong>immediate-recover</strong> IMO</div>

I don't know.  I think the recycle bin is managed by Windows Explorer, so you might have to find a utility (built in or third party) that might make it possible to tell Windows Explorer to delete a folder.<br>
<br>
On a more general note, if I delete a folder tree, causing it to move to the recycle bin, I can only restore the complete folder, not on a per-file basis.  Do you know how to restore only specific files?</div>

				<div class="content">Hi, has there been any change to this so files can be moved into the recycle bin? <br>
<br>
My problem is that while allowing one program 'direct access' to a folder outside its Sandbox, using the open/save dialog built in from that program allows me only to straight delete any files instead of the behavior I am used to. Why isn't there a sandboxed recycle bin if we can't use the real one?</div>

This is the way to go imo. Somewhere in here Peter2150 reported  a malware that used the Recycle Bin as a means to access other partitions on your drive. Maybe Pete can chime in with a reminder on the details.</div>

Hi Mitch<br>
<br>
I think it was a virus that infected all drives on the system.   I don't think it had anything to do with the recyle bin,  as the first thing I do on any new install is disable the recycle bin and system restore.<br>

I thought that was the reason you disabled the Recycle Bin.</div>

				<div class="content">Okay,  I remember.  It was indeed hiding stuff there.    No, I disable the recycle bin, as when I want to delete something, I want it gone.   Anything crucial I have protected by AJC's Active backup, so I don't need the recycle bin.<br>

				<div class="content">Should I make a new thread for my feature request because it looks like we are talking about two different aspects.<br>
<br>
My only problem is the accidental deletions that could happen because Sandboxie does not <strong>move</strong> files to the recycle bin.<br>
<br>
<br>
Could Sandboxie instead allow to only write new files, modify but not delete them? This would be ok as well.</div>

				<div class="content">Wouldn't it be just possible to create a link to the sandbox folder and name it "Sandbox Paperbin" and than do what is said in tzuk's first post? Or would that compromise security? <br>
