				<div class="content">I too would fancy such an ini setting for special cases, e.g. pinning and monitoring a window that loses its display with its focus.<br>
<br>
And I might be presuming too much here, if, like it <em>sounded</em> to me, you want to multi-box? It is conceivable to make an application believe its window(s) be active, never inactive (probably only a matter of dropping some WMs), (with say a custom dll) but that is not enough... Infer from my next paragraph that keyboard input for example, will not be propagated.<br>
<br>
Multi-boxing (and Sandboxie): It wouldn't be too difficult to duplicate input messages, send (synchronous) or post (async), in a spread across chosen (Sandboxes and their) top-level windows. But I'm sure there are already (compatible) solutions available.</div>
