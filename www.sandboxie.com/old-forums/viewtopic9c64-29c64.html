(1) On KIS, got to Settings -&gt; Addition -&gt; Threats and Exclusions -&gt; Specify trusted applications<br>
(2) Add "Firefox" and change the item "Do not scan all traffic" to "Do not scan encrypted traffic" and check the box next to it<br>
(3) Press Save</div>

============================================<br>
Webroot Antivirus 9.0.15.40 + 5.17.4 continues to give grief with Firefox64bit on W10 Home.<br>
with Webroot Application Protection at Protect
<div class="inline-attachment"><!-- ia1 -->FF 64 w Protect.png<!-- ia1 --></div>
with Webroot Application Protection at Allow
<div class="inline-attachment"><!-- ia0 -->FF 64 w Allow.png<!-- ia0 --></div>

LUV to hear from Webrooter running Firefox64bit. <br>
 <br>
I have to move Webroot Application Protection for Firefox to Allow in-order to get Firefox64bit to launch okay. <br>
With Webroot Application Protection at Protect. Firefox64bit never gets past trying to launch.   <br>
<br>
LUV to learn if Webroot + Firefox64bit glitch is ...just me.<br>
<br>
I've tried new default Firefox profile, new default sandbox, new Firefox64bit install w/wo Firefox32bit on-board.  <br>
<br>
LUV to know if Firefox64bit glitch is.....just my setup.<br>
<br>
<em>Thanks</em></div>

				<div class="content">Hello bjm,<br>
<br>
It doesn't seem to be just you. I was able to reproduce the problem (thanks for the extra info in the PM), by installing Webroot and adding Firefox 64 under<br>
Identity Protection--&gt;  Application Protection --&gt; Add application<br>
Then selecting "Protect"<br>
When I attempted to launch Firefox in a Sandbox, I saw the same behavior as your screenshot, it just hangs there and never launches. <br>
<br>
So far, the obvious workaround is what you already posted, setting the protection  level to "Allow" or removing it from the list.<br>
I will update this thread if we find anything else.<br>

<br>
<span style="color: #0000FF">Question @ Invincea<br>
<br>
By doing what I did, did I lower my security any with Sandboxie?<br>
What else can I turn on to increase my security with Sandboxie for my browsers?<br>
I have screenshots of every setting, if needed. </span><br>
<br>
@ everyone else - Can you please test and verify you get the same results?<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<strong>System:</strong> Windows 7 home premium SP1.  <br>
<strong>Installed software:</strong><br>
Kaspersky Total Security 2017 17.0.0.61<br>
Sandboxie 5.16 Registered version<br>
EMET 5.5.5871.31892<br>
DeepFreeze<br>
Firefox 52.0.1 32 bit<br>
Firefox 51.01 64 bit<br>
Chrome 57.0.2987.110 64 bit<br>
Thunderbird 45.8.0<br>
IE 11<br>
Opera 44.0<br>
<br>
<strong>Changes to Sandboxie to get this working:</strong><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Added Kaspersky to the compatibility list</span><br>
<br>
<strong>Firefox (See attached image):</strong><br>
<br>
Under Resource Access/File Access/Direct Access<br>
Add program --&gt; avp.exe<br>
Add folder (under avp.exe) c:\Program FIles\Sandboxie\<br>
<br>
<strong>Extra settings:</strong><br>
Forced program = firefox.exe<br>
Drop my rights is on<br>
Auto delete contents of sandbox checked<br>
Immediate recovery is off<br>
c:\temp added to quick recovery<br>
<br>
<strong>Chrome</strong><br>
<br>
Create a new Sandbox based off of Firefox.<br>
Change the forced program to chrome.exe<br>
Program stop\Lingering Programs added chrome.exe<br>
<br>
<strong>Opera</strong><br>
<br>
Create a new Sandbox based off of Firefox.<br>
Change the forced program to opera.exe<br>
A bit slow to delete the sandbox, but does it on its own.<br>
<br>
<strong>Thunderbird</strong><br>
<br>
Build sandbox from scratch. <br>
I have it set to never delete <br>
I have upgrade issues over last few years worth of Sandboxie versions... but it works<br>
<br>
<strong>IE 11</strong><br>
<br>
Total waste of code... it just hangs for me right now. I do not use IE unless forced, so I have not spent much time trying to figure it out, yet.</div>

Do the steps provided on pages 11 and 12 (top part) work for you? <br>
The Direct Access  option works for applications running inside the Sandbox, if your AV is installed on the host then you should not need to use that setting.<br>

				<div class="content">KIS 2017 worked with out of the box settings for both Sandboxie and KIS. (I thought it was still broken, so I was trying KTS)<br>
The issue with SSL interception will occur on all browsers, so I just turn it off across the board. I run an edge hardware firewall that intercepts, decrypts and scans SSL traffic, so this is not as big an issue for me. <br>
Since SSL is going to give the same warnings for all browsers it seems, turn it off by going to <br>
<br>
Settings/Additional/Network/choose do not scan encrypted connections, click OK to the popup. (See pic)<br>
<br>
I maxed out all my settings in KIS and still had no issues in Sandboxie with Firefox.<br>
<br>
I still can't get IE 11 to work at all. It "starts" but no gui appears and eventually locks up the entire machine and all I can do is hard shut the laptop down. I will create a video so you can see this, as soon as I get more time to test. <br>
<br>
I had to add <strong>two files</strong> to chrome for lingering issues, but after that no issues.<br>
<br>
I have a lot more testing to do...</div>

				<div class="content">Like stonerd in his above posting I would like to give a positive comment for the combination of Sandboxie with a Norton product (+ Firefox):<br>
<br>
The positive experience I had described about 6 months ago (<a href="viewtopica0c2a0c2.html?p=125207#p125207" class="postlink">posting from December 27th</a>) is still valid. No conflicts any more all this time.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
This applies at the moment for the following combination:<br>
Windows 7 Home Premium (32 bit)<br>
Sandboxie 5.18 (32 bit)<br>
Norton Internet Security 22.9.3.13<br>
Firefox 53.0.3 (with Norton Security Toolbar disabled [as it was always])</div>

				<div class="content">Like stonerd &amp; Peter123 in their above postings, I also have no issues with the combination of Sandboxie with a Norton product (NIS) (+ Firefox):<br>
<br>
This applies to the following combination (for me):<br>
Windows 10 Creators Update (64 bit)<br>
Sandboxie 5.18 (64 bit)<br>
Norton Internet Security 22.9.4.8<br>
Firefox 53.0.3 (64 bit) also with Norton Security Toolbar disabled<br>
<br>
I believe it is a bit of a strange one with regard to Norton &amp; Firefox, as I've never had issues with either, going back to Sandboxie 5.12 (with win 7 and when Firefox wasn't available as 64 bit). And naturally even now I think it's recommended to use 32 bit firefox, but I've been using the 64 bit version since it was available without major issue (other than the usual electrolysis not working in conjunction with sandbox settings, which about:config edits fixed at the time, and the very minor cosmetic window rendering color issue - which actually affects Thunderbird more than Firefox).  But Norton without the Toolbar hasn't got any issues from my perspective, (with the Toolbar, a different story from memory, but I never found it very useful anyway).</div>

You can either disable BitDefender, or add "WriteFilePath=C:Program Files\Bitdefender Antivirus Free\*" to your Global configuration in Sandboxie.<br>

Great this worked for me. The problem "SBIE2204 Cannot start sandboxed service RpcSs (-1)" occured after Bitdefender Antivirus Free was updated to Version 1.0.8.20 - NOW, with the line added SANBOXIE works again.
