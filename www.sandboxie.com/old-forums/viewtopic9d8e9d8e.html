I've found a temporary solution to the "Sandboxie doesn't work if Comodo Firewall/Antivirus is installed on Windows 10" problem.<br>
<br>
First make sure you have the latest version of Sandboxie installed. I've tested using Sandboxie V 5.01.13<br>
<br>
Open Comodo and click Open Advanced Settings.<br>
<br>
Go to Defence+ / HIPS / HIPS Settings. You will see a setting called "Detect shellcode injections". <strong>Make sure it's checked because the solution doesn't work if it's disabled.</strong> (You don't need to have HIPS enabled if you don't want to, just make sure "Detect shellcode injections" is checked).<br>
<br>
Now click on Exclusions. In the window that opens right click and choose Add -&gt; Files.<br>
<br>
Go to the Sandboxie folder located in Program Files or Program Files (x86) and select all the executables you find there<br>
<br>
"Start.exe""License.exe""SandboxieBITS.exe""SandboxieCrypto.exe""SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe""SandboxieRpcSs.exe""SandboxieWUAU.exe""SbieCtrl.exe""SbieIni.exe""SbieSvc.exe"<br>
<br>
Click OK to add them, then click OK in all Comodo windows that are opened.<br>
<br>
Now Sandboxie works  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green">  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green">  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> <br>
<br>
One more thing. I've discovered all this by accident. After the latest update Chrome would crash on start (Google Chrome has stopped working) if Comodo was installed. The solution I've found was to add C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe to the same Exclusions list in Comodo. This had nothing to do with Sandboxie, but it gave me the idea to try and do the same thing with Sandboxie's executables.</div></blockquote>

I just wanted to add here that I was running SB v5.14 x64 on Win10 anniversary version and SB was still not working for me, even after I added the files to Comodo's AV exclusion.<br>
<br>
BUT, I saw this post about added them under the HIPS+ exclusion, even though I have HIPS off, and now SB lives again for me!  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> Thx to Johnny_B</div>

				<div class="content">Guys, I've just managed to make it work with the Kaspersky Internet Security suite (latest version) installed on Windows 10 Pro x64 Version 1607 (Build 14393.447)!<br>
I've already tried this method earlier, so I think it's related to a recent update of Windows, Kaspersky or Sandboxie.<br>
First add *everything* that is related to Sandboxie to the exceptions/trusted programs of Kaspersky. All folders, all executables, all dll's, and also the installer.<br>
(I've already had this set up from one of my earlier attempts)<br>
<br>
1. Remove network cable<br>
2. Quit Kaspersky from system tray (don't forget to set up all the exceptions first, and maybe reboot)<br>
3. Install Sandboxie (most recent version)<br>
4. Try to run something in the sandbox, except Microsoft Edge! (more info later) The endlessly looped message about the "not implemented service" should be gone!<br>
(not sure about the english terms - I use the german version)<br>
5. Resume Kaspersky<br>
6. Insert network cable<br>
<br>
I've tried to get it to work so many times... Especially because this issue wasn't present earlier. I've used Sandboxie for quite a while together with Kaspersky. Finally I can use it again, that's awesome! I really hope this works for you too, guys!<br>
<br>
What made me a bit curious, is that when I started a program in the sandbox for the first time, I got a strange report from sandboxie that I've never seen before... There is "not enough space" and "click ok to increase it" or something like that. It was a very small increase, something like from 57812 kb to 57844 kb. <br>
Can't remember the exact wording and size, I've kind of rushed through it. However, after that everything was working fine. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
The only thing I've changed on my PC since the last time I've tried to get Sandboxie to work, is installing a "RAM Cache" program. (Primo Cache)<br>
That's a program to use some of your RAM to increase disk cache, to speed up read, write or read+write performance. (I use it in read mode)<br>
But I hardly can imagine that this has anything to do with Sandboxie. But if - then it could be the reason for the strange "increase space" info, and/or maybe it could also the reason that it works now with Kaspersky? If my described method doesn't work for you, try to install the demo version of Primo Cache, set it up to read mode on all internal drives, and tell me if it worked!<br>
<br>
About Microsoft Edge: <br>
When I tried to run it in a sandbox, the Edge process (iexlore.exe) has frozen, and I couldn't run the Windows Task Manager anymore. It just didn't launch when trying to run it from Task Bar. (via right click) <br>
And the screen that appears when pressing ctrl+alt+del didn't appear anymore. I've also tried to kill iexplore.exe from a third party Task Manager, but access was denied. And the reboot command also didn't react. I had to use the reset button on my tower. <br>
After booting up I've tried it again, with the same result. This time there even was a check disc on reboot, and I had a strange lag of about 2 minutes after booting, before I could do anything. Luckily, everything went back to normal after a while. <br>
So I recommend to not try it with Edge... All other browsers I've tried - Chrome, Firefox and Vivald - were all working perfectly fine.</div>

So is it only on Windows 10 you got it to work that way or does it work with windows 8.1 as well?<br>

Please let me know as my license is about to expire for Kaspersky Pure 3 where sandboxie worked fine.<br>

				<div class="content">Hello Guys &amp; Gals,<br>
<br>
I am writing you to let people know Kaspersky Total Security 2017 works with Sandboxie now.<br>
<br>
My old version of kaspersky was set to expire so i took a chance and downloaded latest Kaspersky and installed it.<br>
The I added exclusions for install directory and the c: drive sandboxie main folder.<br>
<br>
<br>
Currently i am using the Sandboxed Firefox while I type this message.<br>
I have tried a couple other programs and all work great.<br>
Either Windows, Sandboxie or Kaspersky Fixed the issue I assume since it works now.<br>
<br>
I suggest you download the latest version to be safe.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps others.<br>
Have a Great Holiday Season / Christmas<br>

				<div class="content">I am slightly optimistic that the latest version of Sandboxie (<strong>5.16</strong>) could be compatible with <strong>Norton Internet Security</strong> + Firefox. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">   <br>
<br>
I made the Sandboxie update at 19th December - more than a week ago - and since this time Firefox started in Sandboxie <span style="text-decoration: underline">always</span> with the first attempt and <span style="text-decoration: underline">always</span> without delay (or to be precise: only with the small, normal delay of a few seconds). Altogether that must have been some dozens of starts which worked all without problem. - I assume that some change in the latest update of Sandboxie is the reason for this pleasant situation.<br>
<br>
So other users who still have Norton on their computer might give it a new try too.<br>
<br>
I use the following combination:<br>
Windows 7 Home Premium (32 bit)<br>
Sandboxie 5.16 (32 bit)<br>
Norton Internet Security 22.8.1.14<br>
Firefox 50.1.0 (with Norton Security Toolbar disabled [as it was all the time])</div>
