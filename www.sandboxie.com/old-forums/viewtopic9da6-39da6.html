				<div class="content">I have had to uninstall version 22 and rollback to 20.<br>
<br>
It took me years to figure out what was causing the delays running Firefox in Sandboxie. The answer, mainly, is to disable access to the history database. That reduced sandboxie/firefox loading times from 70-90 seconds to 5-7. That's still slower than Chrome, i.e. or SRWare Iron, but it is acceptable.<br>
<br>
As soon as I permitted the upgrade to 22, the loading time shot back up and last night I even timed it at just under 3 minutes. <br>
<br>
I checked all the settings, to see if access to history had been re-enabled or anything else had obviously changed. It hadn't. <br>
<br>
This morning I've reverted to 20 and the loading time is back to 5. <br>
<br>
I think you have a problem.<br>
<br>
Suggestions?</div>

				<div class="content">Hello HarryStottle,<br>
<br>
Does the issue occur in a new Sandbox? <br>
Do you have any antivirus software installed?<br>
<br>
Please provide the required information so that I can test the scenario. <br>
<a href="viewtopic633b633b.html?f=11&amp;t=19746" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=19746</a><br>
We have not received any other reports about Firefox's history causing issues, so we need more information to assist you.<br>
<br>
Also, please upgrade to Sandboxie 5.22 and provide the output of your Resource Access Monitor, as well as a copy of your Sandboxie.ini so that I can review them.<br>
<br>
For the sandboxie config file go to Configure--&gt; Edit configuration<br>
Copy/paste the contents to your response, highlight them and click on the "&lt;/&gt;" button to format it. <br>
For Resource Access Monitor, please follow these guidelines, then post the output here following the same formatting requirements listed above.<br>
<a href="../ResourceAccessMonitor.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/ResourceAccessMonitor</a><br>
<br>
Regards,<br>

				<div class="content">will do all of the above but probably not for a few days as I'm working on a deadlined project that gathering your evidence is likely to take an hour or so I can't currently afford.<br>
<br>
One quick word on your reference to Firefox history. <br>
<br>
That is an interesting issue in it's own right and I'll gather the evidence you outline for that alone before I deal with the upgrade issue. This is because the history problem exists and can be demonstrated (at least in my environment) on all versions as far back, at least, as .15. <br>
<br>
But it very definitely is NOT relevant to the upgrade issue as I had already disabled the link to firefox history (which is a pain, as I DO want the link to the bookmark database and have to sacrifice that as well) in Version 20 and confirmed that it was still off in 22.</div>
