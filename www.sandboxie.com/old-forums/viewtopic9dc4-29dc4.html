				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I've been testing Sandboxie quite a bit and I am very impressed --especially with how often it is updated (one of the main reasons I have chosen sandboxie over the other competitors). I'm about to buy but I have a question. I have set the service to manual (I only plan to use it when browsing or to test applications) I have Sandboxie Control set to not start with windows but I do have it set to "Start when a program starts in the sandbox"<br>
<br>
So from a fresh reboot (service off) I can start Sandboxie Control and the service automatically starts which is great. I can then run any program I want sandboxed.<br>
<br>
BUT if from a fresh reboot, if I don't start up Sandboxie Control first and just try right clicking on an item in the start menu and select "Run Sandboxed" I get an error telling me that the service has not started... I was expecting Sandboxie Control would start automatically after I try running a program sandboxed... (and Sandboxie Control would then start the service.)<br>
<br>
Wouldn't the setting "Start when a program starts in the sandbox" automatically start Sandboxie Control and the service? <br>
<br>
My goal is to leave the service off, but be able to click on a sanboxed program --which would then automatically start the service.. is this possible?  <br>
<br>
I'm using Windows 7 64 bit experimental protection...<br>
<br>
Thanks, hope you can addres this -this is a big reason for me wanting to buy Sandboxie...</div>

				<div class="content">OK I haven't found a solution but I found out the problem is Sandboxie Control doesn't have admin rights to start the sandboxie service automatically...<br>
<br>
I've gone into the install folder and changed SBIECTRL.exe compatibility properties to "Run as Administrator" yet I am still getting this error.<br>
<br>
How do I permanently give Sandboxie Control rights to start the sandboxie service? (I still want to leave UAC on for security purposes)<br>
<br>
If I can figure this out, I'm going to purchase it. Thanks.</div>

				<div class="content">The setting "Start when a program starts in the sandbox" actually starts Sandboxie Control by sending a request to the Sandboxie Service to start it.  So you can't use this setting to have Sandboxie Control start the Sandboxie Service.<br>
<br>
I don't think there's any way other than something like a shortcut on your desktop to "c:\windows\system32\net.exe start SbieSvc".  Have this shortcut as administrator, and click it before you want to run stuff with Sandboxie.</div>

				<div class="content">Not to dismiss your desire zentype, but if you run a tight ship to begin with then I don't think you'll ever have to worry about that service lurking in the background on even a very, very low end PC. For what it's worth, I've always gone to great lengths to sweep out unnecessary services and when I started out with Sandboxie I used to have batch files that could stop and start the service but I quickly realized how lightweight and painless it really is and just let it be. As much web browsing as a typical pc does I wouldn't think you'd spend much time without the service anyway.<br>
<br>
Be one with the Sandboxie service. <br>
It's a harmless little feller. ;)</div>
