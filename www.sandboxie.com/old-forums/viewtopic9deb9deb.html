				<h3>[.01] Chrome Will Not Close With SB 4.02 and EMET 4 Win8 x64</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Wed Jun 19, 2013 10:19 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>hgf321798</strong></div>
				<div class="content">When closing Chrome while running in a sandbox under EMET 4 it appears to exit, but  1 or 2 chrome.exe processes remain running. So clicking the X and then opening Chrome again results in many duplicate chrome.exe processes running in the sandbox. I can close them in task manager or in the Sandboxie Control window.<br>
<br>
The problem does not occur under EMET 4 when chrome is run outside a sandbox. Removing chrome.exe from the EMET 4 list works, but even just adding chrome to the list and disabling all mitigations results in the problem.<br>
<br>
Tried in multiple sandboxes with different settings (forced programs/folders, drop rights, etc.) with the same results. Tried deleting Chrome AppData, and running without extensions.<br>
<br>
I've had a few other programs occasionally stay open after closing (firefox,7zip, few other random programs), but nothing else that I can reliably reproduce like Chrome.</div>

				<div class="content">Can confirm the same behaviour (even after diabling all mitigations) for all other programs (firefox, sandboxie, mediemonkey) running sandboxed and under EMET v4 protection. <br>
Seems to happen only on Win8x64 (couldn' reproduce it with Win7x86) and happens only with EMETv4 final (with EMETv4 Preview it was not there).</div>

				<div class="content">Same problem except I'm using Firefox. I closeout Firefox but the sandbox contents is not deleted. Sandboxie is still active and in Task Manager Firefox is still listed. I can kill Firefox in Task Manager and Sandboxie deletes the sandbox contents. I can also choose Teminate All Programs in Sandboxie's right-click listings and the sandbox contents are deleted plus Firefox is closed in Task Manager.<br>
<br>
In EMET 4.0 beta everything is fine. I'm using EMET 4.0 beta right now because with EMET 4.0 final Firefox and Sandboxie 4.02 are unusable.<br>

Hey, tzuk.<br>

				<div class="content">Short update. I played a while and find out the following:<br>
(1) In EMET change system wide DEP settings - for exmple to Application opt in.<br>
(2) Reboot.<br>
(3) Choose DEP settings that you want again. <br>
<br>
Since I've done that I wasn't able to reproduce the issue. Can anyome recheck?</div>

				<div class="content">Setting the system-wide DEP to opt-in does seem to fix it, but using opt-out and disabling DEP just on chrome or setting the system back to always on makes the problem come back.</div>

Hi Bo<br>
Thanks for responding.  I think I have seen that post.  But I believe he was using the latest beta version of sandboxie rather than version 3.76.  <br>

<br>
It should fix the issue where EMET 4 was causing Internet Explorer to hang during start up.<br>
<br>
I am sorry but I did not remember to check what effect this has on Firefox closing, but hopefully this is fixed as well.<br>
If not, please let me know.</div>

4.03.01 fixed my problem with EMET 4.0 final and Firefox 21. The sandbox contents are now deleted when I close. I can now run DEP with setting Always On instead of Opt-in.<br>
<br>
Great work (as usual). Thank you very much. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">.<br>
