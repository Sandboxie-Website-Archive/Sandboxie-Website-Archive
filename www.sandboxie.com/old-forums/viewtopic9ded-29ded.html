The slowness that I felt in earlier betas running Outlook Express and Windows Explorer sandboxed is gone (XP). <br>

Thanks, now I have hope! <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> Regarding registry speed, you must have done something? Performance on regedit search (Keys/Values/Data) is nearly TWICE as fast as .04! Can we get some more of that? <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"> Nearly doubling again would be better than 3.76. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
Also, I'm still wondering about possible kernel memory leaks I asked about awhile back in 3.76 (unless just Windows weirdness, but you said you'd look into it after the 4 beta), plus others now in 4.01. I have Task Manager screenshots before and after closing sandboxed programs. It was active for 20 days, and you can see kernel memory drop 200 MB (same as 3.x). Also running that whole time, OE, and its memory usage increased continuously (maybe slower at the end) and well as SBIE's GuiProxy process (same PIDs as earlier Process Explorer screenshot), and that did NOT drop at all after closing stuff... I'll watch .05 now. It <em>seems</em> to be using less CPU time (but still more than 3.x).<br>
<br>

Now the interface/GUI slowness... I immediately noticed populating and scrolling the ListView controls (Explorer, OE messages, etc.) was very fast again (no need to measure). So I guess that's like 3.76. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> Still noticed general slowness, however (launching, opening new windows, Open/Save dialogs, etc.; more in a sec). I see you fixed the Firefox Save As click-Cancel-twice-to-actually-cancel glitch.<br>
<br>
Then I went to check PerformanceTest's 2D Windows Interface benchmark, and was going to say, "I see what you did there." <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"> Just optimized for that benchmark, but other stuff was still slow? (Did you ever run it?) Haha, no I see that's not true now, and I guess what fixed the ListView stuff <em>really</em> fixed PerformanceTest: I'm seeing like <strong>20% better</strong> Windows Interface scores sandboxed now, compared to UNsandboxed! <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> Not sure how that's happening (maybe FindWindow() is faster sandboxed without "other" windows? *shrug*)<br>
<br>
<br>
That's all I thought there'd be to report, until I wanted to verify that Recent Documents still won't work at all... I hadn't tried with OpenWin=* on the main system before to check Recent Docs, but I did that and launched IE 6 to do a test "Save As," and guess what? It was WAY faster, felt nearly like 3.76! I waited till later to get some AppTimer numbers from the laptop, but... Basically no difference there; few hundredths, but I'd expect that if a whole chunk of code is bypassed with * <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> So then before my other post yesterday, back to this system to check AppTimer...<br>
<br>
(This is all about launching IE 6.) Main system, usual SBIE settings: <strong>1.22s</strong> (I originally said over a second, though I hadn't timed anything in forever here), which I think is better than .04 going by laptop comparisons. When I just added OpenWin=*, that dropped to <strong>0.5s</strong>!<br>
<br>
I only have a few OpenWin, including 2 templates (AutoSizer, EMET), so would try removing them. One of the first was for Recent Documents (since it doesn't work anyway):<br>
<br>
OpenWinClass=&lt;Open/Save Files&gt;,$:explorer.exe<br>
<br>
Bingo! Somewhat. That takes launch time down to <strong>0.7s</strong>. Besides launching, interface stuff is much better then, but I still feel/see some slowness with new windows, Open/Save... But with Open=*, that stuff is <em>nearly</em> as fast as 3.76, but not quite. I can no longer see slow redrawing (like OE toolbar), but still feel a delay with windows opening (even though it's VERY fast compared to 4.01 with Open=$:explorer).<br>
<br>
The slight remaining extra slowness vs 3.76 is about proportional to  the launch difference. For reference, IE with 3.76 takes <strong>0.4s</strong> (<strong>0.37</strong> with Open=* [again, expected with code bypass]; NO other OpenWin settings have an effect), and &lt; <strong>0.2s</strong> unsandboxed.<br>
<br>
Back to 4.01: I wanted to see if i could get more details for you, so I tried other stuff 12 hours ago. Does the number of OpenWin entries matter? No, tried adding 20 different Dummy windows. Program prefix/group/number of group programs matter? Nope.<br>
<br>
Then the last thing I tried was <strong>really interesting</strong>. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> Use * with a prefix (Open=iexplore.exe,*): takes <strong>2.7s</strong>! Instead of way faster like global *, it's way slower. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> So there's that discrepancy, plus the $:explorer.exe slowdown that doesn't exist in 3.76.<br>
<br>
On the clean, default laptop, the differences are much smaller, but certainly distinctly measurable with AppTimer. Not sure why the HUGE differences on this system...<br>
<br>
Hope these specifics help. Sorry for the long post, just wanted to provide detailed feedback! <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> It almost feels like we could get to 3.76's performance now, or perhaps better. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> Nice progress in 1 update!</div>

Running for 4 days now, and it looks like the SbieSvc processes are only using <em>maybe</em> 25% of the CPU time as .04! <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> (Of course usage pattern, etc. isn't exactly the same, but major reduction there). GuiProxy's memory still looks to be increasing each day (but not msimn.exe so much this time so far)...</div>

I have an issue on each of my computers (XP/W7) while using V4 but none with my browsers. Actually, I feel both of my browsers (IE9/Firefox) feel great running under V4.<br>

I uninstalled the AV and it's working fine now. Bitdefender AV Free did not like Sandboxie. Someone had to go, and Bitdefender went out the door. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

Thanks.  I have to say in the end I didn't get to review your notes prior to releasing version .06.  I addressed a bunch of problem and wanted to get that out for review.  But I am still planning to look into the points you raised, very soon.</div>
