<br>
<strong>First issue:</strong><br>
Windows 10<br>
sandboxie 5.05 beta<br>
 and Firefox 41.02 (Set to default browser)<br>
<br>
When I open up a sandboxed browser, firefox is invisible (as in the process is running in the task manager but I don't see the program at all). I can open up firefox normally unsandboxed fine and it works.  However sandboxed it doesn't work. What gives?<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Second Issue:</strong><br>
Same setup<br>
Eraser 6.2.0.2970<br>
Command line: "C:\Program Files\Eraser\Eraser.exe" erase /quiet /method=bf8ba267-231a-4085-9bf9-204de65a6641 dir="%SANDBOX%"<br>
<br>
It doesn't work I keep getting error "The requested operation requires elevation (740)" but eraser is already running as administrator... <br>
<br>
<br>
I've been using Sandboxie for several years now and I've never been so mad at it not doing basic things properlly. Any solution would greatly be appreciate by me and my sanity.</div>

<br>
2, I would disable Eraser to see if that alleviates the FF issue.As other have had issues with Eraser/FF/SBIE working together. <br>
You also want to disable add ons/extensions. <br>
You want to see if the core browsers works, then we can move on from there.<br>
<br>
As for eraser, look here and try these steps after you confirm if FF works without it. <br>

Not sure what to tell you, other than following @Bo suggestion to v5.06 (If it's just Beta v5.05....and no .2 or .3...) then that's the most likely issue..... and then update FF . <br>
<br>
I did some unrelated tests in FF this morning on Win 8.1 and 10 (both 32/64) with FF 41.0.2 and FF Beta 42. FF loaded "as sandboxed" without issue (no A/V installed, other than defender &amp; no extensions/add ons)  (there is also a thread where I tested Browsers installed DIRECTLY into SBIE.. <a href="viewtopic7fa77fa7.html?f=11&amp;t=21974" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 11&amp;t=21974</a> )<br>
<br>
What caused you to reformat you PC while using Win 10? There are many many recovery options in Win 10 that are far less destructive and less time consuming.<br>
<br>
If you still have problems after 5.06 RC, you can send us information, you would need to do the following steps (step 1 at least)<br>
<br>
<strong>Step #1 You can use procmon and post the results to us. </strong><br>
Procmon: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb896645.aspx" class="postlink">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/lib ... 96645.aspx</a> (free.)<br>
Close any programs that are not needed:<br>
<br>
Run Procom (not sandboxed) and then try and fire up FF (sandboxed of course). Let the error happen or it not load, stop capturing events in Procmon (under file) and then Save the results (under file, make sure "save all events it ticked") and save in PML format. These files can be large, so post somewhere we can download and look. (Please zip them!) and link to <a href="mailto:Support@sandboxie.com">Support@sandboxie.com</a><br>
<br>
<strong>Step #2:</strong> If you can give us a snapshot of your installed software by opening Powe Shell (as admin) and type:<br>
<br>
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product | Select-Object -Property Name &gt; C:\Software\PCapps.txt <br>
<br>
The PCapps.txt will be created listing your software, file you can send to us as well as the PML</div>

Interesting that FF didn't crash or trigger any errors. But, I may be the KB, and hopefully 5.06 will resolve this issue.</div>

No crash or SBIE errors, probably because Firefox has not being able to run at all after reformatting. <br>

Well, Other than confirming you've deleted the contents of that SB and you're not running any antivirus, you would need to provide us with more info:<br>
<br>
Step #1 You can use procmon and post the results to us. <br>
Procmon: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb896645.aspx" class="postlink">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/lib ... 96645.aspx</a><br>
Close any programs that are not needed:<br>
<br>
Run Procom (not sandboxed) and then try and fire up FIrefox (sandboxed of course). Let the error happen or it not load, stop capturing events in Procmon (under file) and then Save the results (under file, make sure "save all events it ticked") and save in PML format. These files can be large, so post somewhere we can download and look. (Please zip them!) and link to <a href="mailto:Support@sandboxie.com">Support@sandboxie.com</a><br>
<br>
Step #2: If you can give us a snapshot of your installed software by opening Powe Shell (as admin) and type:<br>
<br>
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product | Select-Object -Property Name &gt; C:\Software\PCapps.txt <br>
<br>
The PCapps.txt will be created listing your software, file you can send to us as well as the PML</div>

				<div class="content">Fordefy, if you are using an antivirus other than Windows defender, I would disable it or uninstall it for testing. Are you using same AV as before reformat? Sometimes antiviruses after an update, cause this Firefox doesn't pop up open despite being visible in SBIE control.<br>

				<div class="content">If Avast was causing your issue, we probably would  be hearing about it from a lot of other people by now. But, the one really bad case that I remember about an AV causing what you describe...was after an Avast update. So, you might want to uninstall Avast to see what happens.<br>
