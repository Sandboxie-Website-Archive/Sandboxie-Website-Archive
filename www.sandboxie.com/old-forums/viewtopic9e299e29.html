If you want fixes in 4.19.1 beta.  You'll need to install 4.19.1 beta.  Or, wait for 4.20<br>
SBIE installers are forward / backward compatible.  So, if you have concern re 4.19.x beta.  Or, if 4.19.x beta presents problem.  You may simply over install 4.18 and post your beta experience.</div>

Thanks, Curt !   Although a beta snapshot, 4.19.1 is almost as good as a stable version.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>

Hi henry. Forcing Excel is broken in 4.18. In my case use, installing 4.19.1 is important because any Office type document that run in my computers, run sandboxed every time. Even when I create the document. <br>

Thanks, Bo. I nearly always work with my own xl* and doc* files, so have never bothered to sandbox them.<br>
<br>
I'm trying the beta as usual as they are always pretty stable. The beta release was very quick after 4.18, and I had sort of hoped for a Win10 beta, but TBH the public release of the OS is now close enough for me not to want to bother any more with the preview.</div>

Given that the latest preview was a disaster for me, ie broke stuff, and given you lose control of Windows Update, you might want to bother before jumping into the release.</div>

I just upgraded to this. Windows 7 x64.<br>
<br>
When I copy anything (CTRL+C) in a sandboxed Firefox I get this:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>SBIE2205 Service not implemented:  CloseClipboard C0000058</code></pre></div></div>

Same here.<br>
Edit: Also with 4.18. The possible reason could be the Windows patches today.</div>
