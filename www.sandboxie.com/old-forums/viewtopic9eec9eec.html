				<div class="content">I recently read someone else report a similar issue, but I can't find their post.<br>
<br>
If I save/open a file from a sandboxed program (eg. Firefox) and click New Folder on the Open/Save dialog, nothing happens. If I check the sandbox, a new folder has been created with the default name (ie. "New Folder").<br>
<br>
This worked fine on 3.46, but doesn't work on 3.76 or the new 4.03.03.<br>
<br>
Apparently this is a known issue.</div>

				<h3>Creating new folder</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Mon Jul 08, 2013 12:50 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Tedgo</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I am using 3.76 on XP.<br>
<br>
This has not been a problem with ie8, it works as expected when saving images and web pages. In the last few days I have started using Iron and have noticed the new folder problem.<br>
<br>
One can refresh the dialog and 'New Folder' shows, one can then edit the name followed by refresh. The new name can then clicked on and the data saved. However Iron will often crash during this process.<br>
<br>
It needs fixing soon as IE8 limitations on XP are getting to be a headache.</div>

				<h3>New folder and 4.04</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Mon Jul 08, 2013 4:12 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Tedgo</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Just tried version 4.04 with Iron and new folder now works, thankyou.<br>
<br>
Also clicking on .mht and .htm files in windows file explorer also works correctly, (Ver 4.03 did not work).</div>
