This post is coincidental because I noticed the same thing on my system about an hour ago.   I have several sandboxes and \Device\Mup\ appeared in my default box in File Access&gt;Blocked Access.  I don't know how long it's been there; I've been trying to recall if I had performed some action that resulted in \Device\Mup\  being displayed.  I don't see it in my other sandboxes.</div>

<br>
When you add something in Blocked File Access and press OK/Apply, Sandboxie will tell you:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Windows file sharing can be used to circumvent Blocked File Access settings.<br>
Adding resource to block access to Windows file sharing.</div></blockquote>

And at this point, \Device\Mup is added to the list of blocked resources.</div>

<br>
Am I missing something, or is "\Device\Mup\" obsolete and thus no longer necessary ?<br>

Thanks,<br>

				<div class="content">CloseFilePath=\Device\Mup has been deprecated and replaced with BlockNetworkFiles<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Curt@invincea wrote:</cite>Just open the desired network paths using the normal Sandbox Settings -&gt; Resource Access -&gt; File Access<br>
<br>
E.g.<br>
OpenFilePath=z:\MyFolder<br>
ReadFilePath=\\MyServer\MyShare\MyFolder<br>
<br>
If you currently have ClosedFilePath=\device\mup\, you need to delete that setting. We removed it from automatically being applied because BlockNetworkFiles=y is now the default and is more flexible.</div></blockquote></div>
