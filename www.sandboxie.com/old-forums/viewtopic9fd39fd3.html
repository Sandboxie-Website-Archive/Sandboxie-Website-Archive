				<h3>Drag &amp; drop attachments in Thunderbird don't work when Sandboxed</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sat Apr 14, 2018 7:39 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I have Thunderbird 52.7.0 &amp; both Windows XP Sp-3 &amp; Windows 10.  I used to be able to type a message in Thunderbird, go to an Explorer window &amp; drag a file &amp; drop it in Thunderbird as an attachment.  I can still do this IF I open Thunderbird outside of Sanboxie.  However, when I open Thunderbird using Sandboxie, I get 1 of 2 behaviors:<br>
1)  If I drop the file on the message, I see the "+" sign next to my cursor, but nothing happens.  There's no attachment<br>
2)  If I drop the file on the grey area where attachments are shown, the attachment box opens, but nothing is attached.  Only I I then click on the attachment box, a dialog box opens, which allows me to chose a file to "open"=attach.  However, I still can't drag &amp; drop.<br>
<br>
This didn't happen in the past (I'm not sure the last time before today that I tried attaching a document).  It doesn't happen if I open Thunderbird outside of Sandboxie.  If I do that, I can drag &amp; drop files.<br>
<br>
Is there some setting in Sandboxie that has changed this behavior, as it's happening both in Windows XP &amp; Windows 10?<br>
Thank you,<br>
Phil</div>

<br>
I can repro the behavior. Not all programs work with drag-drop, but I've found 2 workarounds for you:<br>
<br>
Open Windows Explorer Sandboxed. That way, you can drag-drop without issues.<br>
Use Thunderbird's File menu to attach files:<br>
File --&gt; Attach ---&gt; Files(s )  worked fine Sandboxed.  (I am testing on Windows 10 using Sandboxie 5.24 stable). <br>
<br>
All Sandboxie version changes can be found here:<br>
<a href="../VersionChanges.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/VersionChanges</a><br>
<br>
I've made the devs aware in case they have more info to add. <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>

Thank you for your quick reply.  Should I post the drag &amp; drop issue in the Feature Request forum, or is it enough that you've made the devs aware of the issue?<br>

As covered, not all programs will work with drag and drop. The workarounds should allow you to continue using your program without further issues. <br>
You can post a request if you wish to do so, just keep in mind that our priorities are these:<br>

<br>
The devs are aware, and if new info becomes available, I will update this thread.<br>
