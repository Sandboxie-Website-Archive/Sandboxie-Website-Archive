				<h3>Firefox Won't Start After Aborted Update (I Think) [SOLVED]</h3>

				<div class="content">Without thinking while I was working, the pop-up about the newest Firefox ESR release came up and instead of downloading it through my normal process, I just clicked on upgrade. I don't think SBIE allowed the upgrade.<br>
<br>
Normally, I download the installer from the Mozilla site through unsandboxed FF, go through the installation, no issue.<br>
<br>
Now I can't get FF to run sandboxed, it is restricting me from running the .exe file and I have no idea how to recover.<br>
<br>
It is message SBIE1308, cancelling FF due to restrictions.<br>
<br>
Can someone please walk me through this? I don't know how to undo it, because I still don't understand the warnings after all these years.<br>
<br>
BTW, I did go through my normal upgrade process after this headache, the new version is installed, as usual. I can run FF un-sandboxed, no problem.<br>
<br>
Thanks, in advance. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"></div>

<br>
Please see:<br>
<a href="../SBIE1308.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/SBIE1308</a><br>
<br>
If you are still unable to run Firefox, please either delete the contents of your Sandbox or create a new Sandbox with default settings and see if the issue follows you there.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>

I believe I figured it out.<br>
<br>
When FF started to download, it completed (I think), but it didn't install. That's what SBIE stopped, or so it would appear.<br>
<br>
Thinking through the process, I realized the sandbox didn't empty because of this, I emptied it and FF ran immediately.<br>
<br>
First time I have ever, and I mean ever, had any problems with SBIE in 5-6 years.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your prompt reply... <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>
