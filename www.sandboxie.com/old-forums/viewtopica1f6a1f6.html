				<div class="content">Hello:<br>
<br>
Looking for some more feedback regarding Office 2016, Office 365 C2R [Sandboxie Paid versions]<br>
<strong><br>
General feed back [Word, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.]<br>
Problems?<br>
Annoyances? Quirks?<br>
Outlook email..<br>
Performance? Speed, loading, etc.<br>
Saving documents? Editing documents?<br>
.....Anything else. </strong><br>
<br>
If you would like a TRIAL key to test as well, and a chance for Sandboxie gifts, please email me @ <a href="mailto:support@Sandboxie.com">support@Sandboxie.com</a><br>
<br>
We'd like to try and fix any outstanding issues as the stable version comes out for SBIE and before (hopefully) Red-stone update of Windows 10.<br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>

True. Just says "Something went wrong...we couldn't start your program" or some such. I have tried both drop-rights and non-drop-rights and a clean ini file. <br>

Win10 Pro x64 v1511 build 10586.420. SB 5.12 &amp; 13 tried</div>

<br>
No error but it never gets by the start "splash" screen. I let it wait for an hour just to see if it ever got an error but nothing happend.<br>
<br>
Using MS Office 2016 Professional Plus (16.0.4405.1000) MSI install, I'm NOT using the C2R. I am on Windows 8.1 fully patched.<br>
It worked just fine in v5.10.<br>
<br>
I'm running Outlook in a separate Sandbox and have configured the sandbox for Outlook using Settings/Applications/Email Readers and checked the Outlook option.<br>
I have also deleted all content in the sandbox after the upgrade to 5.12 but it didnt make any difference.</div>

And Outlook is configured as your email reader still? Double check. <br>
Paid version of SBIE?<br>
Created a new sandbox (not copying the settings) and try it (select outlook, etc.?)<br>
If all else fails, uninstall SBIE (don't save settings) reboot then reinstall SBIE.<br>
<br>
As for the MSI vs C2R, that really wont matter, as the C2R issue was the way it interacts about licensing and MS, etc. Otherwise, it's the same. <br>
<br>
Outlook 2016 otherwise is working w/ SBIE [It's my default client here]</div>

Emailreader, Yup still configured as Outlook.<br>
Yes I'm using a paid version.<br>
Created a new sandbox without copying any settings and choose Outlook once again in the settings but still wont load. (Same as before)<br>
<br>
Dont have time to reinstall and make a refresh install at the moment but will try as soon as I can and report back. Also have some other sanboxes I dont want to loose the content of right now.</div>

You should, as a best practice, use separate sandboxes for whatever software you are using. FF for one sb, Chrome for another. And for Office, this should be the case as well. You should also delete the contents of your sandboxes routinely to prevent crashing and issues.</div>
