				<h3>Prob with v4; *FIRST* ever with S/B  !!</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sat Jun 22, 2013 6:15 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Bill's Last Stand</strong></div>
				<div class="content">First off, Tzuk, I am a fully licensed and Long Term S/B user. I love it and do my best to 'sell' it to anyone that hears my voice or sees my printing!  *GOOD* software.<br>
<br>
I recently upped to 4 on both my computer and my Wife's, and saw no immediate issue, as we are both running WIN 7 [64] and are used to S/B v3+ working perfectly.<br>
<br>
I *do* use Microsoft Office 2003 for our E-Mail client and Word, with no problems at all in S/B v3, 'Outlook' as a Forced Program. You may know, when you open Word independently it is not sandboxed. But when Outlook is open, BOTH  Outlook and Word are sandboxed. It is no problem to have Outlook E-mail open and also open a Word file.<br>
<br>
In S/B v4 I am finding that opening Word independently, Word opens fine, not sandboxed.  But...If I have Outlook open, in the sandbox, THEN try to open a Word file, I cannot! I note that the program 'splwow64.exe' is then in the sandbox, but that seems to be something related to printing.<br>
<br>
I'm not a programmer, but I've done a lot of messing about in these computers [an old retired Electronics Guy].  I do hope someone has a 'fix' for this, or 'She' will be insisting I go back to S/B v3.<br>

				<div class="content">I just found out that with Outlook forced, and I open Outlook, and Word is running in the sandbox....if I attempt to open a Word file by 'double-click' it still wont open. *BUT* if I right-click and 'open in sandbox'... the file pops right open!    That will keep 'Her' happy, but is that what you expected to happen??<br>

				<div class="content">Hello, I just installed the new version of sandboxie and now I am not able to read encrypted files (using EFS) under the sandboxes, my guess is it happens because now the sandboxed processes are opened using the ANONYMOUS LOGON account, tzuk, is there any workaround to fix this? Thank you for this great software...</div>

				<h3>New Version</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Tue Jul 02, 2013 7:14 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Blackbeat</strong></div>
				<div class="content">As for the new version, I'm curious about a few things.<br>
As you stated, the main behaviour now is restricting before allowing which I really appreciate.<br>
<br>
I didn't like a few main ways of behaviour in the old versions.<br>
Mainly the part where you had to restrict access to specific files instead of allowing it.<br>
Has this changed?<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
I want Firefox to be able to read a specific Filepath on a drive but no other path.<br>
Do I now have the option to ONLY allow the access to this specific path?<br>
So to whitelist only one path instead of having to blacklist every other path on that drive?<br>
<br>
Thanks</div>

				<div class="content">As I said earlier in this topic, these changes are internal, and do not change the way you use Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
Settings may be evaluated at a different point during program execuion, but they are evaluated the same way.</div>
