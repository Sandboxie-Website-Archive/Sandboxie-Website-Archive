<br>
If you have not deleted the files, you can use the following recovery features:<br>
<a href="../index5ca8.html?GettingStartedPartThree" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?Get ... dPartThree</a><br>
<br>
If you have deleted the contents of your Sandbox, please see this entry instead:<br>

				<div class="content">thanks for reply,<br>
What I really wanted to know was if I run some program in Sandboxie and during it's execution it creates and deletes files (e.g. installer). Is there any way to get those files deleted by Installer program?<br>
One scenario is I run an installer and it downloads some files and use it and then deletes it before it finishes, is there any way to see those files ?</div>

---&gt; <a href="../index572c.html?SecureDeleteSandbox" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?SecureDeleteSandbox</a> , you might be able to recover files using recovery tools.<br>
Similar as to what you would do on your host if you had deleted the files.<br>

				<div class="content">I haven't used it, but there's a "No Delete" utility in the "Contributed Utilities and Templates" section of this forum, which might be useful:<br>
<br>
"NoDelete for 32 and 64-bit platforms"<br>
