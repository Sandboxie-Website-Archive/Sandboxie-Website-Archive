				<h3>Sandboxie and SuerSocks5 compatibility issue</h3>

				<div class="content">I just recently purchased the sandbox program and am having <br>
difficulties running SuperSocks5 Cap program in the sandbox program.<br>
I use supersocks in order to utilize a proxy ip address and works fine<br>
 when I run it outside the sandbox, but as soon as I put SuperSocks <br>
in the sandbox, my ip address reverts back to my original address and the outside<br>
no longer sees me as the proxy address? Please help...</div>

				<div class="content">There are some posts about socks5 here but I'm not sure that anyone is running proxy software under Sandboxie.  The idea is usually to have programs in the sandbox be able to use the proxy features that are offered by a program outside the sandbox.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless take a look here and see if turning on LSP mode makes any difference:<br>

				<h3>New compatibility issue with SuperSocks5</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Tue Dec 27, 2011 4:01 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>SandboxieNewB</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I can now successfully access proxy ip addresses through SuperSocks from with the sandbox. However, I am only able to run one(1) supersocks Cap program, and not on each individual Sandbox that I create? I continuously get the "you can only run this program once" message regardless if I am attempting to open Supersocks in different Sandboxes? Please, how can I get around this problem?</div>

				<div class="content">I have a proxy ip address which I open with SuperSocks. All four of the Sandboxes should reflect the same proxy address since I am opening one instance of SuperSocks from within individual Sandboxes(in my case 4 seperate sandboxes). However, when I do this, I am allowed to open only one instance of SuperSockss from one individual sandbox and the remaining 3 sandboxes will not allow me to open SuperSocks since it is already open in one. So basically, I need the Sandboxie program to treat each sandbox i created as a different computer(or desktop?) so that I can open SuperSocks from within each(4 in my case) sandbox.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not sure that I follow your explanation.  In my experience with proxy software -- which I admit is very limited, and was always in the context of looking into a compatibility problem with Sandboxie -- once the proxy software is started, the computer changes to a new IP address and Internet connectivity is routed through the proxy service.<br>
<br>
For this reason it doesn't make sense to me that you would be able to run more than one proxy service at the same time.  At least not with Sandboxie.  You might need to look for a tool that lets you have multiple sets of network routing tables on the same network interface.  If such a tool exists.</div>
