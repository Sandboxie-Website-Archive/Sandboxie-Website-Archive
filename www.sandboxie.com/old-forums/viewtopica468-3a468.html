				<div class="content">Are there any plans of adding support for "RockMeIt" for Sandboxie?<br>
<br>
RockMeIt is a closed (sort of) beta for a Chromium based browser with features similar to Flock.</div>

				<div class="content">Did you type RockMeIt with an I? Isn't it RockMelt (with an l)?<br>
Anyways, since its simply a version of Chromium with some social addon's included, I don't think it needs any special support...</div>

Rockmelt (..) got a completely different interface compared to Chrome aswell.<br>
<br>

It looks more like Opera if you ask me :p. But I was thinking more about "Allow direct access to entire Google Chrome profile folder". I would love to be able to do that in Rockmelt (without too much trouble, that is)</div>

You just need to know the .exe name that the Rockmelt browser uses, and the hard disk location of it's profile folder.<br>
Then use both of those at:<br>
Sandbox Settings &gt; Resource Access &gt; File Access &gt; Direct Access<br>
Use the "Add Program" button to enter the .exe name for the browser.<br>
Then use the "Add" button to select the profile folder.<br>
<br>
This assumes that the browser is installed outside of any sandbox.<br>
If it's installed inside of a sandbox, then substitute "Full Access" instead of "Direct Access", in the instructions above.<br>
<br>
It's possible that the browser might have other .exe names associated with it, as well.<br>
You may have to add those .exe names in the same way as above.<br>
The .exe names should be listed in the Sandboxie Control window, when you run the browser sandboxed.</div>
