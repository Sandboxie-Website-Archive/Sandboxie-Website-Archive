				<div class="content">Just wondering, is there a specific program you want to block? Maybe a closedfilepath to that programs folder might prevent it opening at all. But are you looking for that program to open, but open UNsandboxed? If that is what you want - see SnD's answer above.</div>

				<div class="content">I think this feature will help who has program sandboxed always crashed like me.<br>
SnD's answer is right, however I prefer  running a program unsafely temporarily to crushing.<br>
After all it can provide a way to avoid crashing  temporarily. and you can warn this unsafety to sandboxie user.<br>
Please think it again if it can workable technically. Thank you.</div>

Can you tell me which program is crashing under Sandboxie?</div>

				<div class="content">I wondered if there had been any more thoughts on this old feature request. I think many people could have one program that they didn't want sandboxed for any of a number of reasons (and which gets started at least some of the time from within a sandboxed application)<br>
<br>
I can see that it goes against what sandboxie is for, but it could be a tightly controlled option. Enabled for one program without wildcards. <br>
<br>
If you didn't want to encourage its use it could be made only possible via editing sandbox.ini.</div>
