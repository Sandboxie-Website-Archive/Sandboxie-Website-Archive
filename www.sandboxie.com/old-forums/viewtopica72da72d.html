				<div class="content">Finally installed Win7 64-bit in a virtual machine (via Virtualbox; my host is now Windows 8.1).   I'm finally going to retire my tried and true XP VM which Sandboxie served well.   Right not I'm using IE11 and the current stable release of SBIE works quite well with it.   I noticed a lot of the beta releases address issues with Chrome (I actually use a Chromium derivative called Iron Browser) so going to postpone installing Iron Browser until after the next update to SBIE maybe (but I'm actually liking IE11 even though I really got to like some of the features in Iron and got spoiled since these features are non-existent in IE11 not to mention IE11 still wants to use Flash instead of HTML5 for youtube videos for some reason even though I believe IE11 is HTML5 compliant).  Anyway, just want to again say my kudos to the folk that's still keeping SBIE relevant.    <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>
