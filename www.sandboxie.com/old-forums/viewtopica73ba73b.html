				<div class="content">I once thought /nosbiectrl could prevent SbieCtrl.exe from running. But it couldn't.<br>
<br>
<a href="../StartCommandLine.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/StartCommandLine</a><br>
/nosbiectrl can be used to make sure Start.exe does not try to run Sandboxie Control before running the sandboxed program.<br>
<br>
But actually I see SbieCtrl.exe run always before the sandboxed program.<br>
<br>
So in what scenarios (for what purpose) should we use this parameter?</div>

<br>
You would use that command after having used these settings:<br>
<a href="../ConfigureMenu.html#shell" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/ConfigureMenu#shell</a><br>
<br>
If you uncheck "When a sandboxed program starts" , and Sbie control is closed, you can then invoke apps using the  /nosbiectrl command.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-<br>
<br>
PS: Since sbiectrl.exe will not be running, you will not see the frame around the program's window. To check that the app is sandboxed, see Task Manager and find the user running the process. Sanboxed processes are run by AnonymousLogon.<br>
To triple check, after running the app you can invoke sbie control and you will see it listed there as well.</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you, Barb. You are so kind.<br>
<br>
But the fact makes me even puzzled.<br>
<br>
While that option is checked, SbieCtrl.exe always starts along. /nosbiectrl never works.<br>
<br>
While that option is unchecked, SbieCtrl.exe never starts along. Unless I run it. /nosbiectrl is never needed.<br>
<br>
So what's the exact use of /nosbiectrl ?<br>
<br>
<br>
Re:PS: Yes, no frame... This is not good. (Though I don't worry about the processes since I'm running ProcessHacker, which has trees and highlights.)</div>
