No I am not Spam Police but a concerned user when someone starts posting a lot of the same in different posts trying to be heard or be read. To be honest I get kind of annoyed.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>

I previously said "with all due respect" meaning not to offend you and I don't consider you a troll, how could I? <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>
Thanks for the correction I know it's by not buy, just a typo. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> <br>

I posted one Thread re Cyberfox after I tried Search with no Cyberfox results.   You may be annoyed all you want.  But, why give another that power over you.<br>
Lets check my stats.  Joined Aug 2008.  Total 235 post.  That's approx 30 per year.  Does 30/y exceed some un-published spam quota.  Maybe before you get annoyed.  Check a user stats.</div>
