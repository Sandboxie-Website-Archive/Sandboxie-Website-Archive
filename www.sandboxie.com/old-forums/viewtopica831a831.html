The ball is in MB's court.  They are investigating why MBAE is not attempting to inject into Sandboxie.</div>

It is a problem in Sandboxie but I have no idea where it is located. All I can do is send you a malware you can use for testing and you track down to the origin of the problem.<br>
<br>
You know there is a bug because you already found one related to this issue. Somewhere in Sandboxie code there is still a problem.</div>

				<div class="content">Dropped rights for Chrome is a problem for a few months. Sandboxie fixes something then new Chrome version comes and dropped rights doesn't work again.<br>
In my personal opinion latest Chrome x64 &amp; Sandboxie 4.14 works slower than first x64 Chrome releases and Sandboxie 4.13-3/4 beta. So I switched to pcxFirefox (x64 Firefox), however some sites are broken on Firefox.<br>
Also Chrome with hardware acceleration and flash causes bluescreens for some systems. Not sure if it's the graphics drivers, Chrome itself or something else... I never had bluescreen using Firefox &amp; HTML5 youtube player</div>

I see something similar with Internet Download Manager and Chrome 38 x64:<br>
Chrome is started sandboxed, IDM too (or isn't running at all). But when IDM is started/accessed via Chrome's browser plug-in, another IDM session starts outside of Sandboxie and is able to write outside of the sandbox.<br>
This happens although IDM compatibility is unchecked in Sandboxie.<br>
Dangerous?</div>

I worked around the same issue by forcing IDM to run sandboxed but really don't know whether dangerous.</div>

This is the right forum to post problems and questions regarding Sandboxie releases. <br>
Look, by reading these two post of rpljhun:<br>
<a href="viewtopicea51ea51.php?p=104563#p104563" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 63#p104563</a><br>

and what I told you in my previous post you can easily workaround the issue.</div>
