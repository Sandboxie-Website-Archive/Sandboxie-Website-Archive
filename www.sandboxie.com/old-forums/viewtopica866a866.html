				<div class="content">I don't see why a sandboxed program should be able to do this. In most instances a reboot is needed to finish a driver/service install which doesn't work within sbie anyhow.... Perhaps some timed/event driven auto shut down app might have a legit reason to do so but I'd prefer to have a choice to explicitly enable this (eg setting) for a specific sandbox but have it disabled by default. Failing that, IMO, block it entirely.. :-/</div>

One of our new developers has been looking into this. From the post above, and looking at the code, I assumed that sandboxed apps were being allowed to reboot/shutdown the machine. But apparently, Sbie was already blocking this. The hook code in Sbie that I thought was allowing this apparently is dead code from a time long past.<br>
<br>
So according to our testing, Sbie is already blocking this. Sandboxed apps cannot reboot/shutdown the machine.</div>

It could, if it had a valid request. If malware started to write, etc in the SB...say trying to write a new MBR (sandboxeds) and then rebooted....that's all that would happen. A reboot. As everything is contained in the SB.<br>
<br>
But that's moot now.</div>

If it's a valid reboot command, yes. If it was malware attempting to write and then reboot, it wouldn't matter. The "writing" is happening in the SB, which is gone when the computer reboots. The only harm is...you've rebooted.  That's all..MBR, etc are not changed by a program that is running/writing in the SB.</div>
