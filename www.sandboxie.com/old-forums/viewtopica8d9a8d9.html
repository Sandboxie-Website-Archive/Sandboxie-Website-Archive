				<div class="content">I have been using Sandboxie since 2007 when I first came across gizmo's site, and I appreciate using this great program every single day. O how I wish that I would have come across it sooner...I had been missing out on one of the greatest security innovations of all time. So small yet so powerful! - its a miracle, a one all solution for malware of all forms and for trash residual files that slows down PCs to a halt. I could have never imagined that such A-Grade security software existed till you made it possible. Mr. Ronen, you are one talented developer, a great sorcerer in the security world. Sandboxie is an excellent alternative to VM's, with its <em>way</em> less overhead and with its phenomenal ease of use and transfering of files from the virtual to the real OS. Its by far my number one choice. Now I could use my windows OS confidently, knowing it well be preserved and pristine, instead of going through the hassle of using a linux VM that doesnt really work with most programs I use.<br>
<br>
One thing that I admire in you the most, is your integrity. You were not willing to sellout like all the big companies did, and you refused to make a scarecrow version for 64bit. I have been a very frequent visitor to the forum since installing Sandboxie, its like one great, bustling online community; experienced volunteers always willing to help out and anwser your questions. Mr. Ronen, your dedication, patience and politeness are unparalleled.<br>
After seeing how great Sandboxie was, I uninstalled a half dozen security realtime scanners and the performance gain was immediate. I recommended it to all my relatives and friends. I would suggest that we have a Sandboxie appreciation day on the forum, preferably the day of the month that it was first released <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
While I'm at it I wrote a poem of appreciation:<br>
<br>
Sandboxie, Sandboxie<br>
Tailored for my every need<br>
Bulletproof security, combined with speed<br>
<br>
Sandboxie, Sandboxie<br>
You're worth more, than gold to me<br>
So petite, nifty and neat<br>
<br>
Thank You Ronen, thank you indeed <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>
