I dont use Ublock but I know a few SBIE users that are using it with no problem. Perhaps the issue between SBIE and Ublock that you are experiencing is due to a rule you are using.

You might like to try them instead of Ublock.<br>

I also ditched Noscript and Adblock edge in favour of uBlock origin for the same reason plus it's faster, so I actually don't want to go back. Thanks for the suggestion tho.<br>
<br>
I've just made a new profile, installed my extensions (Greasemonkey, HTTPS-Everywhere, Keefox, Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin, Xmarks) and I'm experiencing the same.<br>
My Firefox has random short freezes when uBlock Origin is activated, the moment I deactivate it Firefox runs normal.<br>
<br>
I used the same setup on Win7 x64 without issues.<br>

I would try another new profile and test only installing Ublock. And adding your list one at a time. Perhaps your issue is caused by Ublock conflicting with another addon or perhaps a webguard while sandboxed, if you are using one with your antivirus.<br>
<br>
About NoScript. In my case, pages load a lot faster with NoScript than without. Same with Adblock plus. I used those addons for about the same amount of time as SBIE, I dont remember ever uninstalling either one because I suspected them causing an issue, sandboxed or not. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>

				<div class="content">When I try to install with this installer, I get a Windows pop-up that reads "Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item." and then when I close out it doesn't do anything else. This is the same for both the merged and the regular 64 versions. But if I download the normal installer from the top bar of the website it installs fine, but installs version 5.04 instead. I need 5.05 because I run Chrome.<br>
<br>
The weirdest part is that I originally had 5.05 on my system but again when I tried to run it (running a browser or the Sandboxie control) it gave me the same error message and refused to open, so I installed the previous version and now I'm stuck.</div>

				<div class="content">There are 2 versions of uBlock, so maybe that accounts for the different results.<br>
<br>
uBlock 0.9.3.5:<br>
"NOTE: Users should be aware that this add-on represents an older fork. The original developer of uBlock is continuing to actively develop the newer fork uBlock Origin.<br>
Users wishing to take advantage of the latest features and development work by gorhill may prefer to use uBlock Origin instead."<br>
<br>
uBlock Origin 1.3.0 is the later version.<br>
<br>
I use the older version and, for now anyway, as far as I can tell it's working fine for me with Sandboxie.</div>

What music player are you using in FF? <br>
<br>
As for themes, we're aware of the problem, however that's a very low priority. It's more of a user customization issue than say, an extension (such as LastPass...etc) normally, we concentrate on the core browser..but we also look at some extensions/add-ons</div>

I tested several times , firefox run less frequently when running app music groove. Maybe it's just a coincidence.
