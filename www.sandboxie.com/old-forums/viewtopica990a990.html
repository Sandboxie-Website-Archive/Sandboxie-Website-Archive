				<div class="content">I have been using and recommending Sandboxie since it was publically available.  Before Greenborder was purchased by Google (and now part of Chrome), Greenborder was the only sandbox software for IE that worked as advertised, until Sandboxie came along.  For a one time price you can register the software and help support the future development of this very important.  I can testify that over the years that not a single malware or poisoned web site was able to cause any infection to any of our systems.  I tested it for over a year before I began recommending to our customers. I has completely eliminated the possibility of maleware infection through the browser.  Although there are other developers of similiar software, Sandboxie is priced great.  I just wanted to let everyone know that Sandboxie has been my top 10 pick of all time, and is the first thing I recommend to my customers for maleware protection.  Keep up the good work Ronen.  We appreciate the value you have give to the computing community.</div>
