				<div class="content">Hello, I really appreciate having this software but I have had to remove it since I'm getting the same problem being reported with dllhost.exe since KB074588 which I don't want to remove.  Is there an update to Sandboxie coming?  Win 10 Pro Version 1709 OS Build 16299.248<br>
Thanks</div>

				<div class="content">Have Win 10 Pro 32 bit, was on the Business channel, but with my update to Ver. 1709 yesterday, I see the terminology has changed to Semi-Annual Channel. After the update to 1709, I tried Sandboxie and it worked, but early today I was notified of some updates that were ready to download. After the new updates were installed, I go the same error message that VitsKip and Hasuki  got when I tried to run Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
Prior to these latest updates, never had problems with Sandboxie. After finding this thread, I uninstalled KB4074588, and Sandboxie works fine again. Since I just upgraded to Ver. 1709 yesterday, I don't think I ever had KB4058258, just KB4074588, which was installed this morning.</div>

<br>
I feel bad for the program developers who have to try to keep up with what seems more frequent system changes Microsoft is making now. With 2 "Feature Updates"  a year, it's like Christmas coming twice a year, but you often find a lump or two of coal ( programs not working properly) in your stocking.</div>
