				<div class="content">I'm just an old Ham Radio operator, dragged into 'computering'....primarily to be Mail Agent for one of my Kids working in Brasil at that time. I have a deep, long, electronic background, that has become virtually useless in this Era of Everything Being Ones and Zeros.  As such I have literally haunted a number of technical forums, trying to come up to speed. I HAVE picked up a lot of bits and pieces, such that I almost qualify for being Old One Eye in my family and small circle of 'not kids' friends. [In the World of the Blind, the One Eyed Man is King]. But..........<br>
<br>
NO Forum, or other technical source has been as informative, helpful, and educating as SANDBOXIE FORUMS. Not  ONE  'RTFM' or other nasty or mean comment....and I appreciate that very much.<br>
<br>
I'll always remain thankful to Ronen Tzur, for his creation...but also this very, very, good Forum.... <br>
<br>
I'm pretty much caught-up these days, but my bookmark for this forum remains in daily use, snooping and learning...<br>
<br>
"Best" to all of you.<br>
