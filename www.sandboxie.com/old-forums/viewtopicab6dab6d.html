				<div class="content">I think I will lock the Feature Request forum until further notice.  I am not sure that it still serves its original purpose.<br>
<br>
And I do still have quite a lot of stuff my to-do list that originates from old Feature Request posts.<br>
<br>
Perhaps after I've addressed all that to-do stuff, I will re-open the forum.<br>
<br>
So I will probably lock the forum tomorrow.</div>

				<div class="content">Good decision IMO. Most requests are either rehashes of older ones or just plain irrelevant. It seems everyone likes to suggest things just to see them being added without really thinking about their purpose. Also its good to see that Sandboxie has added increased core functionality and usability while avoiding the featuritis and bloat which commonly ails other software nowadays.</div>

				<div class="content">Poor decision IMO but I understand it.<br>
<br>
Just expect a ton of feature-request-like topics in Anything Else.<br>
<br>
Taking the time to sort out what you've currently got on your plate makes sense though.</div>

				<div class="content">My opinion is similar that of D1G1T@L's on this point.<br>
<br>
In any case, like I said, I already have a long list of stuff to add to Sandboxie, so posting more stuff is only going to end up as more stuff on my to-do list.  So any more ideas can probably wait until later.<br>
<br>
I'm going to start by blocking new topics here, but replying to existing topics is still possible.  We'll see how that works.</div>

				<div class="content">Cool, gotcha.<br>
<br>
It might help people if you posted the to-do list since:<br>
1) They'd see "oh, my request is already being considered."<br>
2) We'd be able to see where the project is going.<br>
<br>
My 2 cents. IDK how the dev process works on your end so it may or may not be a good idea.</div>

				<div class="content">I can see how something like that would be interesting for curious minds, but I feel that might invite second guessing of my plans or having to explain why eventually I decided to do something one way or the other and so on.  When I introduce a new non-trivial feature during beta development, I usually post a dedicated topic explaining it, I think I'll just stick to that.</div>

				<div class="content">You are to choose, Tzuk. However I also agree there's high time to stop the flood of thoughts, have a rest and to reconsider huge to-do list, because dedicated users already have many versions with different features available to choose from.<br>
<br>
Certainly, it would be nice of you to post the most valuable prioritized features that you think would fit SBIE the best, but it's no problem either.<br>
<br>
Good luck.</div>
