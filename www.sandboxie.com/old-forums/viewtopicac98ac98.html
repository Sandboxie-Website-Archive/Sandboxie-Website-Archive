				<div class="content">I think after all these years it is time to move on and get rid of that slice of salami pizza in the taskbar. Honestly, the design of this program doesn't live up to the great functionality that it offers. Can't be that big of a deal to give this program a new and fresh design that looks a little bit more professional. I know that the design takes a cue from a traditional sandbox where children play in. I understand. You don't have to get rid of this completely, but at least give the design a overhaul after all those years finally...<br>
<br>
Please don't get me wrong. I don't want to rant about the program or anything like that. In fact I have been a long time sandboxie user and this should just be a suggestion. Nothing more, nothing less.<br>
<br>
Best Regards<br>

				<div class="content">No, the Sandboxie icon and interface are highly useful and functional the way they are and have been for many many years. I hope it never changes. It works great.<br>

				<div class="content">Not that I like the OPs suggestion, but no, sorry, SB as is, is a terrible and uninformative user interface and needs an overhaul, I don't care if they keep the iconic logo, that's not the problem, and I hope they stay away from the windows 10 "Metro" crap, but when I look at SB, it should tell me whats running and I should be able to interact with those files without jumping through hoops in Explorer. Right clicking on the little taskbar icon should show me what sandboxes are active and whats running in them for example.</div>

Hi Special, both of those functions can be done by opening Sandboxie control. You look in there and see whats running and which sandboxes have activity.<br>
<br>
To open Sandboxie control with one click, you can create a shortcut with this path, and move the shortcut to your task bar (third icon from right to left).<br>
<br>
"C:\Program Files\Sandboxie\SbieCtrl.exe" /open<br>

				<div class="content">No I'm not going to use that clunky window, that's the problem, and I'm living in 2018, not making shortcuts either just to dirty up my taskbar only to open windows explorer a little faster, also then I'm going to have a shortcut problem with 5 sandboxes.  <br>

It's not even a bad idea, but to be honest, I don't think it's really necessary.</div>
