				<div class="content">I know the subject sounds odd, but there wasn't room for more.<br>
<br>
First, I'd like to say that I have no idea how easy it would be to implement such; so, I'd just like to express a wish. If possible to do it, great; if not, it's OK.<br>
<br>
OK. What I have in mind is, suppose you have an e-mail client you do not want to run the e-mail client itself under a sandbox, but you still would like to open its attachments under a sandbox.<br>
My idea is to have a sandbox where I could define to start XYZ process under that sandbox, but only if the process that triggers this XYZ process is on the list. This way, such XYZ process would only run sandboxed under those conditions, and run outside the sandbox, if the process triggering them doesn't match the one in the list.<br>
<br>
Again, if something easy, or something you'd feel OK implementing it, great, otherwise no hard feelings. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

Don't force Firefox sandboxed.<br>
Don't force Notepad sandboxed.<br>

Yes, precisely. The reason for such is that, I recently installed Sandboxie to a relative, but to be able to set it up in a proper way to resolve any program that would not start/run, I decided not to force the e-mail client to a sandbox, because it could be possible that such an alert/some other alert could appear, and my relative didn't want it that way, and also dislikes having to right-click something and choose to run unsandboxed then.<br>
<br>
So, that left me with an alternative: I have sandboxed PDF reader and media player, but I have not, as an example, sandboxed Office applications, otherwise whenever starting some office application it would be forced to open in sandboxie. So, it would be great it would be possible to force xyz *.doc file, *.xls file, etc., if Word, Excel, etc are triggered by the e-mail client process.<br>
<br>
That's just an example.<br>
<br>
This would give my relative the comfort of having those dangerous stuff sandboxed, while the e-mail client, itself, would not. It sure would be way better than not being sandboxed, at all.</div>

I think that, once you figure out the necessary settings for the above workaround, you would rarely if ever see alerts related to the email client.</div>

Thanks for the link.<br>
<br>
I'm aware that once I figure out the necessary settings that most of the alerts would be gone. The problem is I don't have such time, and having from time to time my relative sending me an e-mail or calling me on the phone "Oh, this is displaying an error." "Oh, something is requesting permissions to run in the sandbox, should I allow it?".<br>
<br>
Stuff like that. I really don't have such time. Not to mention it wouldn't be practical, I'm afraid.</div>

Yeah, I totally get that.<br>
<br>
I was kind of assuming that you wouldn't really have to figure anything out, since settings like this should practically make your email program unsandboxed:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>OpenFilePath=outlook.exe,*
OpenKeyPath=outlook.exe,*
OpenIpcPath=outlook.exe,*
OpenWinClass=outlook.exe,*
OpenClsid=outlook.exe,*</code></pre></div>
But who knows, there are always surprises. Anyway, just trying to give you an option if tzuk isn't able to fulfill your request.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
Sorry for bringing this kind of old thread into life... I'm truly an angel, you know. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"> Anyway, I'd just like to say that this would indeed by a welcome feature to Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
So, I vote for this feature. It would be nice if I could force an application to be sandbox only if it was initiated by another application.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks!!</div>
