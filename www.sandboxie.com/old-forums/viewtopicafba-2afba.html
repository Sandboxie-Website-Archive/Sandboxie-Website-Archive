				<div class="content">You can see for yourself by examining the folders underneath C:\Sandbox\(user)\ using an unsandboxed Windows Explorer, both before and then after using Delete Contents.<br>
<br>
Just don't leave Windows Explorer open to that folder while you use Delete Contents, because Explorer will have a lock on the folder and it will not be deleted.</div>

First you are absolutely right, you don't have to justify anything to me, or anyone else.  I asked as I suspected others are wondering the same thing. <br>
<br>
as to your questions.   2).  I've never bothered as I've never seen any reason to install anything in a sandbox.  If I truly want to do that I use a Virtual Machine.  So I don't know the answer to your question<br>
3)  Again don't know as I've never had a reason to bother.  I run my system with Admin rights and use Appguard to provide that kind of protection.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is if you want someone to answer your questions, you might have to provide justification as to why the should expend the effort.   Attitude!<br>

				<h3>program in sandbox needs a file outside sandbox</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sat Oct 26, 2013 6:05 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>richj</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
I am running a program in a sandbox, I get an error message saying that a file is not accessible. That file is in a subdir outside of my sandbox and is apparently not accessible to the sandboxed program. I believe the needed file must stay where it is in App Data because the program is looking for it there.<br>
Any Ideas???<br>
Thanks, <br>
Rich j</div>
