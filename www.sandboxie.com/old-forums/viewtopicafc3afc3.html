<br>
Filename: ntoskrnl.exe   adress: ntoskrnl.exe+1776a9<br>

<br>
Do you have a dmp file that we can review? [They are typically located under C:\Windows ---&gt; memory.dmp].<br>
<br>
Does the BSOD occur in a New Sandbox with default settings? <br>
If you run the game outside the Sandbox, do you receive any errors?<br>
<br>
Have you installed any new drivers lately, or just Sandboxie?<br>

<br>
You can send the dmp file download link to <a href="mailto:support@sandboxie.com">support@sandboxie.com</a> <br>
You'll need to upload it to a file hosting site first. There are plenty of free ones that you can use. <br>
<br>
What are the exact repro steps for kodi?  I installed it and launched Sandboxed, added pictures and cycled thru them. After a while of checking random settings I exited out of it, no issues (so far).<br>
<br>
Can you test the behavior after disabling your Antivirus? <br>
<br>

<br>
No i myself not updated them windows 10 creatrs update done it after install,<br>
<br>
but i gone back to my previous drivers.   <br>
tested also newest and others and some of mid 2016 but all same at sandboxie problems.<br>
<br>
<br>
also think has something todo with <br>
<br>
OpenWinClass=Steam.exe,*<br>
OpenWinClass=*<br>
<br>
when its added to a sandbox also if only added this without that below.   But its needed that sandboxie apps can access other windows !!<br>
<br>
<br>
also think this can also make problems.???<br>
<br>
OpenPipePath=\Device\QWAVEdrv<br>
OpenIpcPath=\Device\PhysicalMemory<br>
<br>
<br>
or this ?<br>
<br>

<br>
Can you please confirm if the issue happens in a Sandbox with default settings?<br>
Create a new Sandbox for testing purposes.<br>
<br>
Also, please try removing "OpenWinClass=* " to see if that alleviates the issue. <br>
<br>

For the time being, remove * to avoid further BSODS. <br>
Why do you need to open "* " ? We usually turn it on to test applications as needed, but not as a permanent fix.<br>

ofc it is driver made, but not sandboxie, maybe an external audio card.<br>

<br>
could be GTA itself. however get the dump!<br>
<br>
btw a (mini-)dump do not contain personal data, only hardware infos and running or loaded processes.</div>

<br>
We are aware of the issue, it is caused by OpenWinClass=*<br>
<br>
It seems to be "new" to Windows 10 CU. We typically do not recommend opening " * ", just use it for testing purposes. <br>
