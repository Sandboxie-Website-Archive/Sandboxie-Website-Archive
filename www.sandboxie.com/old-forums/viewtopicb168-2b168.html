				<div class="content">I built a PC in May with only a SSD and have had zero issues that I'm aware of.  Having said that, every tech forum you go to have questions like, "Is it alright to use "X" on/with a SSD?"  So, anyh issues with Sandboxie and a SSD I should be aware of?  Thank you!</div>

No problem then!  Supposedly I could do an astronomical amount (more than I would ever do in multiple months) of writes and wipes/day and it would last 10 years.  Thank you!</div>

				<div class="content">I keep on the SSD only sandboxes of applications that I access regularly. There's no reason to waste space on the SSD to keep all the sandboxes. If you have a lot of games, then it would make sense to temporarily move the sandbox of a game you currently or frequently play to the SSD and after you're done with it, move it back to a HDD (or delete it).</div>

We, (wife or visiting children) mostly only browse sandboxed but have a few programs like pdf reader to open sandboxed too.  I have Sb set to delete the contents box when it's closed.  Again, years of writes and wipes so I'm not sure how that affects it.</div>
