				<h3>Palemoon menu not visible on Windows 10 [SOLVED]</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I am using Sandboxie 5.16 64bit in Windows 10 Home. My default browser is Palemoon, running v27.0.3 64bit.<br>
<br>
While Palemoon displayed perfectly in Windows 7, I am having a problem since I upgraded to Windows 10. The text in the menu bar is not visible because the text is white and the brackground is white too. This issue doesn't happen when I run Palemoon outside the sandbox. Other users have commented the same problem in the Palemoon forums.<br>
<br>
I contacted Palemoon's developers and they said: "Pale Moon needs access to the registry to know what color the accent color is. If sandboxie prevents that, then it won't work."<br>
<br>
This is how Palemoon looks outside the sandbox:
<div class="inline-attachment">
			
		
				<dl class="file">
			<dt class="attach-image"><img src="download/file1ae51ae5.jpg?id=1055" class="postimage" alt="palemoonok.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt>
						<dd>palemoonok.jpg (8.86 KiB) Viewed 823 times</dd>
		</dl>
		
		
		
			</div>

This is how Palemoon looks inside the sandbox:
<div class="inline-attachment">
			
		
				<dl class="file">
			<dt class="attach-image"><img src="download/file4b754b75.jpg?id=1056" class="postimage" alt="palemoonwrong.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt>
						<dd>palemoonwrong.jpg (8.03 KiB) Viewed 823 times</dd>
		</dl>
		
		
		
			</div>

Any suggestions?</div>

<br>
Try a different theme, such as "Aeromoon" (I just tested that one and it works).<br>

				<div class="content">I see this issue has been marked as SOLVED, but it is not solved. Solving it would mean that Sandboxie allows Palemoon to check the color in the registry or replicates the part of the registry that Palemoon needs to access.<br>
<br>
The workaround allows me to use Palemoon and that's great, but I'd like to recover its default aspect in a future update.</div>

				<div class="content">I posted this issue with Palemoon over a year ago, and the way it was downplayed made me feel I had been ignored. I decided not to buy Sandboxie until the issue was fixed, and it didn't seem it would happen anytime soon.<br>
<br>
A couple days ago, though, I was pleasantly surprised that the issue was corrected in the last update. Now Palemoon looks OK with its default theme. I went on and bought a Sandboxie license for one year.<br>
<br>
Thank you for fixing this.</div>
