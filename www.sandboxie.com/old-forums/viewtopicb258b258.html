				<h3>How to connect to internet only through SB</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Thu May 17, 2012 9:04 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I like to know if it is possible to route all internet connection only through Sandboxie and how ?<br>
Means that if anything connects to net, it will be forced to use SB.<br>
Kind of a forced connection to a SB and then restrict this SB <br>
to only allow a few programs to enter the net, like FireFox and so...!<br>
Any ideas? <br>
<br>
Second Question would be: <br>
I use Kaspersky Password Manager within FireFox and it has <br>
it's password database file, where all my passwords are stored. <br>
They are encrypted, but I like to restrict access to this database only to Kaspersky,<br>
so that it can't be copied,moved or modified by anything else then Kaspersky.<br>
And if anything tries to access it except Kaspersky, to SB it and restrict internet access.<br>
How would I do that ?<br>
<br>
THX in advance</div>
