				<div class="content">In sandbox window we can choose between file and program view.<br>
In program view I would have assumed to exit a process by pressing the delete key as it works in taskmanager.<br>
But it doesn't do anything.<br>
<br>
It's just a small thing but I think it would be a great benefit also because its what people expect to be by default.</div>
