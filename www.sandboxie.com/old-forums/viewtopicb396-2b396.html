				<h3>Per-user sandbox settings</h3>

				<div class="content">I think the ability to control sandbox settings on a per-user basis would be useful.<br>
<br>
For instance, my home computer has several user accounts for the various members of my family.  I'd like auto-recovery (and instant recovery) to work for my sandboxes, but I'd like to be able to disable it completely for my kids.  Unfortunately, disabling auto-recovery for my kids' sandboxes also disables it on mine.<br>
<br>
<br>
As a simple fix, perhaps you can have Sandboxie search the user's folder before it checks the Windows folder and the Sandboxie installation folder?  This way I could simply put a custom .ini file in those user accounts that I wish to restrict.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>
