Our original intent was to not do this, but since it seems to be causing some issues, I'll re-enable it for now.  You should start seeing access to http automatically push you to https.</div>

Now I can be a little less vigilant about checking installer signatures every time I grab a beta release from the forum.</div>

				<h3>A lot of Google web links no longer work</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Thu Jun 15, 2017 2:53 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I'm not sure where to post this. I'm not putting it in problem reports since it's not about the program. <br>
<br>
A lot of google links to sandboxie's website no longer work when I google sandboxie stuff.<br>
The links have a format like `<a href="../phpbb/index.html" class="postlink">https://sandboxie.com/phpbb/</a>` and the new working links have phpBB3 in them. For example the second link in google for sandboxie forum is to a broken link.<br>
<br>
<img src="../i.imgur.com/22AWVkx.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
Here's a thread example
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>forums.sandboxie.com • View topic - RegHive files
https://www.sandboxie.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=16071

Not Found

The requested URL /phpbb/viewtopic.php was not found on this server.

Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.
</code></pre></div>

which is not correct since it's now <a href="viewtopic7fe7-27fe7.html?f=17&amp;t=16071" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=16071</a><br>
<br>
Also file attachments are not working, I tried to upload that PNG screenshot above but nothing happens. I had to use a third party image service.<br>
<br>
<br>
MERGED POST<br>
<br>
Another thing is I'm subscribed to topics and did not receive an e-mail notification this morning for one of them. Not sure if that's just me</div>

What was your search string? I need it so I can see the same results.<br>

Regarding the emails, there was a problem with the IP address but it has been fixed as of today. <br>
Please confirm that you are receiving emails now.<br>

I don't remember the ones I used then. They're pretty easy to find though for example search google for<br>
sandboxie reghive.log1<br>
click on the second link<br>

Yes I'm receiving them now, I received an e-mail notification of an update to this post.<br>

				<div class="content">Hi cornflake,<br>
<br>
Can you try clicking on the drop-down arrow next to the URL (under the link) and select"Cache" ? <br>
It should redirect you to <a href="viewtopic7fe7-27fe7.html?f=17&amp;t=16071" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=16071</a><br>
<br>
If you have more searches that trigger problems, please provide them and I will test them to  find out what's going on.  <br>
<br>

				<div class="content">You can easily see all of them just search for:<br>
site:<a href="../phpbb/index.html" class="postlink">www.sandboxie.com/phpbb/</a><br>
The problem is google still has the old URLs in the search results<br>
<br>
Also now that you have a new board is there a way that you can put the content of forum posts in the emails, like so I can receive a daily update for each post with the posts actually in the email like vbulletin</div>

<br>
It seems that it is just 5 links that are found when performing that search (most of which do redirect). <br>
Give it a try now. Should be resolved. <br>

Regarding the email content, we are not planning on changing that feature at the moment.<br>
