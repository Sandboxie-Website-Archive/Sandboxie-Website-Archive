				<div class="content">SBIE 4.01.06 beta still not letting me print within Firefox and Opera, don't use IE so haven't checked that.  SBIE 3.76 printed just fine, but the problem started while trying the v4 beta builds.  I run Emsisoft Anti-Malware and Online Armor, but even if I disable them completely, the problem still there.  Here is what the resource monitor shows for Firefox...<br>

<br>
As for Emsisoft Anti-Malware please note that it still appear in the log.<br>
<br>
Is it possible for you to temporarily uninstall all your security software -- Anti-Malware, Online Armor, EMET -- to check if this makes a difference?  I know it's a hassle but your position allows you to try to figure out the incompatibility simply by eliminating software from the mix.</div>

Yeah sorry I am using Windows 8 x64 and I didn't have Online Armor or Anti-Malware disabled since I had already tested with them turned off.  But I will remove them and try it again.  Thanks!<br>

				<div class="content">Okay I completely uninstalled Online Armor, Anti-Malware, and EMET from my Windows 8 x64.  To explain further, the print window comes up delayed up to a minute or so because in the meantime Firefox is not responding, then when the print dialog appears, I can't click on properties cause nothing happens and if I press print, it gives me an error.<br>
<br>
I re-ran the resource access monitor....<br>

				<div class="content">Thanks for checking again without the other software, but looks like it didn't make a difference.<br>
On the other hand I can reproduce the problem on 64-bit Windows 8 so this is actually a Windows 8 issue.<br>
I hope I can have this fixed for the next beta version.</div>
