What browser and version of Sticky Pass are you using? <br>
Do you have any AV software installed? <br>

FF49.02; SP 8.09.45; AVG Internet Security 16.121.7859. And Windows build 14393.447 (stopped using Previews).<br>
<br>
SP started ok today, but it is flaky. I've also noticed that FF is freezing now and again, and suspect that may be down to Sandboxie/SP. I may try FF50 again - can't remember now why I downgraded from that.</div>

Killing SP in the sandbox unfreezes Firefox. That's on v 50 BTW - now updated to the beta channel again. Outside a sandbox I get no freezes.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't know about Firefox + Win 10 because I've seen people having problem with sandboxed Steam games there so maybe there is some compatibility issue. But on W7 64, I've been running Firefox 50 since two weeks ago without problem (with electrolysis forced on) but I don't have Flash on my system.<br>
<br>
My setup is just W7 64 with all the latest updates + EMET 5.51 + Sandboxie 5.15.4 + Firefox Unbranded Builds 64 bit version (because I'm running unsigned addons) with e10s forced on + No adobe flash (for flash content, I'll just use Chrome).</div>

So you do not get  any freezing issues on SBIE 5.14  using Firefox and SP? <br>
I'll try again repro the issue on 5.15 , see what we can find out.<br>

				<div class="content">I have an issue with the "Always on Top" setting. When I activate this option the "Sandboxie Control" window is indeed always on top.<br>
I am using the Immediate Recovery option to recover a file after downloading. When the "Immediate Recovery" window pops up and after recovering the file, the "Sanboxie Control" window is no longer "always on top". Only the "Immediate Recovery" window is "always on top"<br>
It would be nice to have the "Sandboxie Control" window always on top even after the Immediate Recovery.<br>
