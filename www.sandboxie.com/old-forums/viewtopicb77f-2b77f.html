				<div class="content">Hello Guys,<br>
<br>
I've a few questions. So here's the first: Is it possible to install a program (or a game) within the sandbox, which is already installed on the computer? I want to do so, cause I want to check which changes a program makes or has made after being started for the first time (or after times, if it's necessary to figure that out), for example, to find the savegame, a previously installed game has made.<br>
<br>
Second question: Is it as simple as opening an explorer window (within sandboxie environment), finding installation files and execute the (e. g.) setup.exe, to install a new program?<br>
Third: Which path will be default for installation be given by the setup program? And which installation path am I supposed to use when installing in sandboxie?<br>
Fourth: I suppose that when I delete the sandbox I used, all the installed programs, etc., will be wiped from my hard disk, right?<br>
<br>
Thank you for your help.</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"Is it possible to install a program (or a game) within the sandbox, which is already installed on the computer? "  </div></blockquote>
Yes, provided the program can be installed inside Sandboxie.  <br>
Also, you can run Steam Sandboxed (for example), block it from seeing your currently installed games, and then select a new location to install your Sandboxed games.<br>
Here's a thread that might help you set this up:<br>
<a href="viewtopic95109510.php?f=11&amp;t=23941&amp;hilit=steam" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... ilit=steam</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> Is it as simple as opening an explorer window (within sandboxie environment), finding installation files and execute the (e. g.) setup.exe, to install a new program?  </div></blockquote>
Yes. You can also find the installation file, right-click on it --&gt; Run Sandboxed, or just drag-drop it in Sandboxie Control.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Which path will be default for installation be given by the setup program? And which installation path am I supposed to use when installing in sandboxie?
</div></blockquote>
You can choose any paths you want. It would be the same as selecting it on the host (but it will be created inside Sandboxie) . <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I suppose that when I delete the sandbox I used, all the installed programs, etc., will be wiped from my hard disk, right?</div></blockquote>
Correct. Here's more information regarding how the delete process works inside Sandboxie:<br>
