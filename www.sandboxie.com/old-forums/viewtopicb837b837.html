Does the beta help fix that issue? [ <a href="viewtopic99029902.html?f=61&amp;t=24329#p127601" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 29#p127601</a> ]<br>
Do those Antivirus programs install any extensions? <br>

Agree a clean install would probably be great but it's also a last resort since all profiles would have to be re-created from scratch.<br>
<br>
Do you know if a 'Windows Refresh' where the user files are retained would work? I will try it if I encounter more problems but insights from someone with good information would be helpful.</div></blockquote>

coffeecup25,<br>
<br>
I always do a clean install on every major Windows upgrade which is the best way without running any problems. I know it is a hassle and wasting time for reinstalling all your apps, configure settings, and move all data back but everything works great and smooth after doing that. I hate the upgrade process since it will breaks something along the way which I had ran into in the past. <br>
<br>
As for Windows Refresh, it is a hit or a miss which is not like a clean install. It might fix some problems or it might not. There is an option to keep all your personal data if you go that route. However, all your software or apps will be deleted. The "C:\Users" folder will be untouched which means that everything inside that folder will be retained. Make sure you select keep your data if your reset or refresh your OS if you don't want to loose all your data. <br>
<br>
Always backup all your important data to an external drive, preferably SSD since it doesn't die on you unexpectedly. I had an external HDD which died on me and I lost all my data. Don't make the same mistake like I did.<br>
<br>

Very likely the error will go away after you upgrade to 5.19.4. Do it.....now  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">.<br>

				<div class="content">Hello bassmastergg ,<br>
<br>
Try rebooting your system. <br>
<br>
If that does not help, try disabling Chrome's sandbox:<br>
Create a new Chrome shortcut on your Desktop (or desired location)<br>
Right-click --&gt; properties on the newly created Shortcut<br>
Update the target to reflect the following: " --no-sandbox " at the end (no quotation marks) <br>
This should be added after the quotation marks in the Target area, leaving 1 space <br>
<br>

Barb.-</div>

If the sandbox is not set to delete on closing, another thing you can try would be deleting contents.<br>
