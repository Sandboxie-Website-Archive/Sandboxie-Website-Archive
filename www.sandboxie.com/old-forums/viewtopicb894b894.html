				<h3>Using a sandbox on a network share</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Fri Jan 19, 2018 7:05 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Is it possible to run a sandbox on a network share? From what i can tell it should be possible but i am having no luck.<br>
<br>
With my use case i am running sandboxie on my daily pc which is a virtual machine. <br>
<br>
On my back end i have a parity protected array and specific SSD drives that i am using as a network share. Instead of creating a new drive image (in case it corrupts etc) to store my sandboxed items i would rather store them directly on the share. This also gives me the ability to transparently move files on the back end as the need requires.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have created a symbolic link on my c drive "C:\Sandbox\SandboxCache" which points to "\\192.168.168.99\Sandboxie Cache"<br>
<br>
If i run an installer i get:<br>
SBIE1212 Cannot create directory '\Device\Mup\192.168.168.99\Sandboxie Cache\testbox'<br>
SBIE2314 Canceling process Start.exe<br>
<br>
Note that the 'testbox' folder, reg hive and drive folder were created on the network drive.<br>
Deleting the contents from sandboxie is also successful.<br>
<br>
I have tried opening pipes to this directory etc but to no avail.<br>
<br>
<br>
The computer has write permissions and sandboxie does indeed write there so i dont know what else to try.<br>
<br>
Why would sandboxie try to be writing to '\Device\Mup\192.168.168.99\Sandboxie Cache\testbox' instead of "C:\Sandbox\SandboxCache\testbox"?<br>
<br>
Any help would be appreciated.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Barb,<br>
<br>
Windows 10 64bit<br>
Sandboxie v5.22<br>
<br>
Software involved. MSI installers, my testing installers in this case is the default MinecraftInstaller.msi or 'PDF Xchange EditorV7.x64.msi<br>
<br>
No antivirus running outside of windows defender.<br>
<br>
<br>
I create a symbolic link at "C:\Sandbox\SandboxCache" which points to "\\192.168.168.99\SandboxieCache"<br>
<br>
I create a 'test_sandbox' whos filerootpath C:\Sandbox\SandboxCache\%SANDBOX%<br>
<br>
- I am able to install steam without issue. Steam however gets stuck permanently 'cleaning up'.<br>
- Installing an MSI file results in SBIE1212 Cannot create directory '\Device\Mup\192.168.168.2\SandboxieCache\test_sandbox'<br>
   - Adding Full and direct access to these folders does not make a difference.<br>
<br>
<br>
Note running the above installers in a sandbox not on a symbolic link to a network drive work without issue.<br>
<br>
<br>
There was another test installing steam in a sandbox on the c drive and storing the games on the network drive (via symbolic link) with direct access.<br>
This scenario works without sandboxie error however steam goes into a game permanent update scenerio (Where the files are on the network drive) which does not happen on the local drive. This indicates there is a permission error however in this case sandboxie does not report anything.</div>

Maybe I am not following, but can't you just set the root folder to the network share that you want to use? You will still need to follow the steps I provided before: <a href="viewtopic98e298e2.html?p=130918#p130918" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?p=130918#p130918</a><br>
If OpenFilePath doesn't do the trick, do OpenPipePath instead. <br>
<br>
I tested that setup and I was able to save a notepad file to the location I gave access to on my network drive.  (It will not work for other drives like C: drive unless you also open paths for them (this is probably why you cannot finish installing your apps), which kind of defeats the purpose of running things in a Sandbox). <br>
<br>
The symlink behavior was the same as with the root folder change. However, the performance will degrade a lot when using this setup, just to keep in mind. Launching a web browser took several minutes, saving a notepad file took almost 40 seconds...<br>
<br>
I also found further discussions about this (older, but may still apply):<br>

				<div class="content">I had less luck trying to use the root folder directly to the network share.<br>
<br>
Using the direct approach without symlinks and trying to open as much access as possible i have done:<br>
<br>
FileRootPath=\\192.168.168.99\Sandboxie\NetworkSandbox\%SANDBOX%<br>
OpenPipePath=\Device\Mup\192.168.168.99\Sandboxie\NetworkSandbox\<br>
OpenPipePath=\\192.168.168.99\Sandboxie\NetworkSandbox\<br>
OpenFilePath=\Device\Mup\192.168.168.99\Sandboxie\NetworkSandbox\<br>
OpenFilePath=\\192.168.168.99\Sandboxie\NetworkSandbox\<br>
<br>
Under restrictions -&gt; Network Files i have unticked to block network file access<br>
<br>
<br>
If i run notepad in this sandbox and save a file to the My Documents folder i get ' C:\Users\Me\Documents\test file.txt Path does not exist'. Note i get this error for any path i put in</div>

The only paths that will work are the ones within the network drive you are selecting as your root folder.  For other drives, including C: drive, you will need to manually open the paths as I explained on my response above. Again, this setup is not recommended. <br>

<br>
What if i want the saved location to be sandboxed?<br>
<br>
If i openfilepath or openpipepath to the for example 'My Documents' then the location is directly accessible and defeats the purpose of a sandbox.<br>
<br>
My goal is to have my sandbox functionality the exact same whether the sandbox location is stored on a physical drive or a network drive. eg if i save to 'Program Files' then it is saved in the sandboxed location of 'Program Files'. (ie change 'Set Container Folder' to a network drive and have it work the same as the one on the c drive)<br>
<br>
If i get this right and opening direct paths is the only way this works then it defaults the purpose of the sandbox.<br>
<br>
You can see why i went the symbolic link route as it had some better results however there were many inconsistencies with that as well. (Hence this post)</div>
