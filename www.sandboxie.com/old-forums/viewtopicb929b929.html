I  can't delete the files in Sandboxie by push the button"Delete Content". Sandboxie says allways, that there are pogramms still running. Also when I finished all programms, that I had started. And in fact you can see that Mcafee is still running (SaUI.exe / Mcsacoe.exe). It dosn't help to push the Button "Terminate  Programms".  (I have Windows 7)</div></blockquote>
Seems to me that Mcafee is the program causing your sandbox not to delete. Perhaps there is a conflict between McAfee and Sandboxie, it has happened before.<br>

				<div class="content">Hello, I could solve the conflict with McAfee by deleting McAfee from the software-compatibility-list. Now I can delete the files in the sandbox. It seems to me a little bit curious.</div>

				<div class="content">Had the exact same problem. Deleted Sandboxie and did not save settings. Reinstalled and  deleted McAfee from the list of settings as well. Everything works fine now. I agree, go figure!<br>
<br>
Many thanks for the fix. Sandboxie is a must these days.</div>
