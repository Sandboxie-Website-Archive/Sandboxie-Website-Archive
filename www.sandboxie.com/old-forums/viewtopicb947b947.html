				<div class="content">Hello, <br>
<br>
I have the same problem as Umbra. When I try to activate Sandboxie, the message "Product activation failed: Product Key was activated on too many computers." appears. I bought Sandboxie few years age and, probably, I have a lifetime license (at that time, there was only one type of license, I remember).<br>
<br>
I use 4 or 5 PCs  only in my house. <br>
<br>
Thanks.</div>

I believe activation process should not include IPs. Some ISPs/countries have dynamic IPs such as mine, needles to say laptops activating against sbie servers in different networks/ips.<br>
Activation should be based only in a unique hash: hwid + sbie key<br>
This way if my key is stolen some way, I should not care as long as I show a proof of ownership (Invincea invoice)</div>

I agree with you. We take that into consideration too. But if the registered owner is in the UK, then the next day in Japan, then later that evening activating in South America...then, that's a problem. Or someone have severe jet lag.</div>

It means the key has been stolen or being abused, then I should not care as long as I show a proof of ownership (Invincea invoice). You Invincea can block different activation hashes and talk with customers which machines it owns.</div>

Usually, if someone emails about a key that has been compromised, we can search Cleverbridge and see past orders and issue a new key. But for now, we use the the system that was put in place by Ronen.</div>

Dynamic IP is something... normal here in Poland. DSL connections are not so stable but popular. So IP number may change few times per week.<br>
When I use my mobile internet connection, my IP changes every 60 minutes.<br>

Looks like personal license was well spend money  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>

I like how Adguard resolved this. You see all PCs on which the license is currently used. You can bind and unbind licenses via website.</div>

There are a lot of options out there, far better options,  for handling licenses. One day.....one day.</div>

Well, I have the "old" lifetime license that entitles me to use it on all my PCs. I only own 3 anyway but the thing is I am running VMware on one and am experimenting with a lot of stuff there, including installing Sandboxie and then surfing the web using CyberGhost VPN. And that could show me as travelling the world with the speed of light - although I'm just using VPN and faking IPs. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> And the same goes for other Sandboxie users, of course.</div>

I wouldn't worry, and if anything comes up, always email us and we can fix licensing keys quickly.</div>
