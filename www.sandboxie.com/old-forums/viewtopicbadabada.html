				<div class="content">Curious how others are organizing their boxes. <br>
<br>
I currently have one default box that I use for low-risk web browsing &amp; downloads.<br>
<br>
I have a second box that I use to try out new programs, addons, etc.<br>
<br>
And a third box that I reserve for more higher-risk behavior (more unknown programs, etc)<br>
<br>
The first box I allow some permissions to the main system (file recovery, bookmarks, and history). The other 2 I keep quite quarantined. Pretty simple.</div>

				<div class="content">x75, in short, I try to separate programs from each other as much as possible . Consequently, I create separate sandboxes for most programs. That way, I can set up each sandbox according to the program. I try to restrict sandboxes as much as possible without giving up any convenience. So, I have separate sandboxes for browsers, PDF reader, video players, Office programs, EMail clients, you name the program, if I am using it, it is likely I have it set to run sandboxed automatically when it runs.<br>
<br>
Also, I force my Downloads folder and USB drives, that way if a program runs out of there, it runs sandboxed automatically. I also have a Windows explorer sandbox, I normally use that sandbox for specific purposes, like for example, navigating to pictures or any file that I might download that I dont feel to sure about what It is. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>

				<div class="content">I tend to sandbox like bo.elam.<br>
<br>
Currently:<br>
<br>
<strong>SBDefaultBox</strong> - Default<br>
<strong>SBAlcatraz</strong> - Very limited file system access, no internet, drop rights, sbiextra dll etc<br>
<strong>SBFirefox</strong> - Limited file system access, only firefox can run, firefox forced<br>
<strong>SBIExplorer</strong> - Limited file system access, only IE can run, IE forced<br>
<strong>SBMediaPlayers</strong> - Limited file system access, all media players/image viewers are forced<br>
<strong>SBNull </strong>- No programs can run.. All drive letters other than my HD partitions &amp; ramdisk are forced to this, as are all startup folders and download folders. Mostly used to prevent autorunning. Also means I can browse a USB pen without fear of accidently running something. To open a file I either move it or right click and run in a different sandbox / outside of sandboxie<br>
<strong>SBSteam</strong> - Limited file system access, SteamWebHelper/ErrorReporter forced<br>
<strong>SBTOR</strong> - Limited file system access, only TOR browser+dependencies etc can run<br>
<br>
If I install PDF readers, email clients etc they'll also get their own sandbox.</div>

				<div class="content">I try to make it simpler. I start with, will the sandbox be set to auto delete, or not. Most of what I choose to auto delete I run in the same sandbox. For instance if I have 4 browsers, in my usage I am not going to be using them at the same time. I know I could have 4 seperate sandboxes. But actually nothing is lost if I set up just one box for all 4 browsers.</div>
