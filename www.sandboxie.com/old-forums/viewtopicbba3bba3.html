<br>
Can you please provide the settings that you are using along with:<br>
<a href="viewtopic633b633b.html?f=11&amp;t=19746" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=19746</a> <br>
<br>
Does the issue happen in a new Sandbox with default settings? <br>
I tested giving access to the Firefox profile, and NoScript worked. So if you can provide your settings, I'll test them and see what needs to be updated. <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>

Hi jclark, there is no conflict between Sandboxie and NoScript 10. I am using NoScript 10 in W7 and W10.<br>
<br>
If you want to save NoScript 10 settings out of the sandbox, you need to allow Firefox Direct file access to file "storage-sync.sqlite", this file is located inside your Firefox profile folder. Pre NoScript 10, NS saved data in prefs.js, but that changed in Firefox 57 with the release of NoScript 10.<br>

Bo -- Thanks!  This sounds like the right answer, but I'm afraid I need a little more hand-holding:<br>
<br>
1) Do you mean to add something like the red line in a block like the following, dating from earlier versions?<br>
<br>
"[Template_Local_Firefox_Addons_NoScript_AdBlockPlus_NoSquint]<br>
<br>
Tmpl.Title=Misc Add-ons for Firefox<br>
OpenFilePath=firefox.exe,*\adblockplus\*<br>
OpenFilePath=firefox.exe,*\prefs.js<br>
<span style="color: #FF0000">OpenFilePath=firefox.exe,*\storage-sync.sqlite</span><br>
OpenFilePath=firefox.exe,*\NoScriptSTS.db<br>
OpenFilePath=firefox.exe,*\ABE\Rules\*<br>
Tmpl.Class=Local"<br>
<br>
2) Is the line below it (OpenFilePath=firefox.exe,*\NoScriptSTS.db) still necessary?<br>
<br>
3) While we're at it, do you know if the AdBlockPlus line in the same block is still correct?<br>
<br>
4) In general, can you point me to instructions for how to do this kind of tinkering and what it means?<br>
<br>
Thanks again, and Happy Holidays! -- jclarkw</div>

				<div class="content">Open Sandbox settings&gt;Resource access&gt;File access&gt;Direct access, Click Drop down window, Click on Firefox, Click Add, navigate to the files you need to allow access for NoScript and Adblock plus by following the paths below:<br>
<br>
In Firefox 57, for NoScript, you need to allow access to "C:\Users\jclark\\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\xxxx.default\storage-sync.sqlite<br>
<br>
In Firefox 57, for Adblock plus, you allow access to "C:\Users\jclark\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\xxxx.default\browser-extension-data\{d10d0bf8-f5b5-c8b4-a8b2-2b9879e08c5d}\storage<br>
<br>
In Firefox 57, there is no need anymore to allow access to prefs.js for ABP or NoScript but you might want to allow access to it for changing some Firefox settings or about:config. You can disregard any other file you listed for NoScript or ABP as they dont apply for Firefox 57 and the addons. HTH, J.<br>
