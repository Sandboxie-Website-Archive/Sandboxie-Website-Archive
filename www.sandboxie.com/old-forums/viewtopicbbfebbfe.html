				<h3>Switch view between Programs &amp; Files and Folders</h3>

				<div class="content">I have a suggestion that would avoid confusion.  Right now, when you switch views between Programs &lt;--&gt; Files and Folders, the view may change which sandbox you're looking at.  It seems that each view has a separate "memory", and subsequent view changes return to the sandbox you were previously looking at in that view.  I find this confusing.  Usually when I'm in one view and I want to change views, I want to see the same sandbox, not a different one.  More than once I start navigating the files and folders view and can't find what I'm looking for, only to realize later I'm looking at the wrong sandbox.  This could result in accidental data deletion (for instance, checking for files you want to recover before "Deleting Contents".<br>
<br>
Can you please change the View feature to default to the currently selected/viewed sandbox when switching between views?<br>
<br>
Thanks for considering this.<br>

<br>
The devs were made aware of this request back then.<br>
<br>
If/when anything changes about its status, we will be updating this thread.<br>
At this time, it is not a priority. <br>
