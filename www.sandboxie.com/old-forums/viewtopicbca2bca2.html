				<div class="content">If outside the sandbox, Firefox always opens your Home page, and thats not the case when you run the browser in the sandbox, then you probably need to delete contents of the sandbox.<br>

FF run within the SB will use the settings that are present on your host. Also, you should make certain that FF is set as your web browser in Applications in SBIE.<br>
<br>
If you set google to be your homepage in FF outside the sandbox, it will persist when run in the SB (you have to make certain that your contents are deleted in that SB routinely.)<br>
<br>
Not sure what help uninstalling / reinstalling will do..other than cause a headache. If you were getting errors that indicated that, maybe. But this is a setting, cookie, stale SB content issue.</div>

Make sure FF is set to open to the correct webpage when started, outside of the sandbox.<br>
<br>
Close FF, Open FF again to verify.<br>
<br>
Delete contents of your sandbox and/or create a new SB.<br>
<br>
Open FF in the the Sandbox.</div>
