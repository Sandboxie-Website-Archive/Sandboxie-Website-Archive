				<div class="content">This isn't possible.  The changes are too great.  Having this options actually means having two Sandboxie engines, with this option choosing between them.  It's just not something I can even consider.<br>
<br>
But, hold on, like I said, I will look into the conflict, maybe there will not even be a need for drastic measures.  No promises though!   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

				<div class="content">The story continues...<br>
<br>
The conflict lies in the fact that with an Altiris layer enabled, the SbieDll helper DLL does not get loaded into the sandboxed process.<br>
<br>
If this is the whole crux of the matter, then perhaps by the next beta, I may be able to resolve this, by re-introducing another way to inject SbieDll into sandboxed programs.<br>
<br>
(Note that this 'another way' was in use in version 2.64, which perhaps explains why there was no conflict with Altiris in the older version.)</div>

				<div class="content">Yep, that was it, the alternative SbieDll injection method works fine with Altiris.<br>
<br>
It is a bit worse than the primary SbieDll injection method, in that the DLL is not injected as early, but for 99% of the programs this shouldn't be a problem.<br>
<br>
(I'd like to emphasize that the alternative method is not used <em>instead of</em> but rather <em>in addition to</em> the primary method.)<br>
<br>
This fix will be published in the next beta version.</div>

				<div class="content">I tested the 7.8 and altiris and it still does not work properly, when a layer is loaded and I try to start a program in sandbox i get an error: SBOX2604 Cannot mount registry hive [C0000034 / 33].<br>
<br>
When I have something aleady running in the SB mor apps starting works fine.<br>

				<div class="content">Sorry about that, but I don't experience this error.  (I've been testing with an "Empty Layer", if it makes a difference.)<br>
<br>
This particular error means Sandboxie was unable to query the registry key:<br>
<br>
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\hivelist<br>
<br>
This key is opened for <em>read</em> access.  If Altiris decides to block access to this key... Well, I can't do very much about it!  (But like I said, this did not happened to me.)<br>
<br>
Another conflict that I saw, has to do with creating files in the root directory of a drive.  It makes the sandboxed program not see the contents of the real directory.  This isn't a bug in Sandboxie.  Strangely, this only happens on the root directory.</div>

				<div class="content">Strange,<br>
I tested it now with an new layer with an other software installed and it works it also works with an empty layer.<br>
But with the first layer witn an other software is fails (there was a dl manager called GetRight installed)<br>
I tested an other layer with adobe and it works also, so it seems it depands on the installed software.<br>
