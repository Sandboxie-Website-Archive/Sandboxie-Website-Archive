				<h3>ACL Permission of Sandboxed files</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I realise that ACL for folders &amp; files created in the sandbox are currently fixed at 'Authenticated Users' and current user.<br>
<br>
I am setting up a PC with multiple user accounts mainly for web surfing. The browser will always be run in a Sandbox. Before putting in Sandboxie, each user's files are protected by ACL of the accounts. However with Sandboxie, a user will be able to look at other users' sandboxed files. <br>
<br>
This is also mentioned in another thread -<br>
<br>
<a href="../phpbb/viewtopic2de9.php?t=8031&amp;sid=f103be9b9695dcacad792e820adff175" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/phpbb/viewtopi ... 820adff175</a><br>
<br>
What is the rationale behind giving access to Authenticated Users?<br>
<br>
Is it possible to change the ACL to 'Administrators' and current user?<br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">The rationale is to try to make it easier to access files in the sandbox from any account, and get rid of them easily if you need to.  You're actually looking to have it the other way around.  But perhaps I can add such a sandbox setting that selects between Authenticated Users and Administrators for the files in the sandbox.</div>

				<div class="content">Wouldn't have Sandboxie configured per user account solve this problem? That is, each user account would have its own configuration file and its own Sandbox directory, and only the current user account and Administrators group would have access to the sandboxes. But, other users wouldn't.<br>
<br>
As a limited/standard user, I'd be able to do whatever I want with my sandboxes, but other limited/standard users have access denied. As an administrator I'd be able to access all sandboxes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks</div>

Thanks for the prompt response.<br>

Hope this setting will be out soon. Thanks.</div>
