Hi,<br>
<br>
I have Windows 10, Build 10240 (see screenshot above please. Sorry to be obvious about it) and it seems Sandboxie isn't working on my laptop. I tried to get it working many different ways, but I wasn't able to. <br>
<br>
Do you have any suggestions sir?<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

Never heard of the game. It may or may not be supported. Make sure you are using v5.01.4, You're still using release candidates? MS is pulling those back. Does the game work non-sandboxed? It may be a DirectX12 driver issue and at this time, that's not supported. SBIE is a BETA, so it may take some time &amp; everything may not be supported in the future.</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you for the reply Craig, <br>
           Ok so I can't find v5.01.4 and I am now using v5.01.6 which is the latest beta as of now. The programs I am trying to run with sandboxie are Google Chrome and IMVU. None of them are working but Internet explore seems to be working just fine with v5.01.6. When I was using v5.01.5 , Internet Explore wasn't even working with it. I just want to run IMVU and Google Chrome with sandboxie so can you please make them work?  Thanks again for your fast reply!</div>

IMVU isn't supported as of yet. IE 11 and Chrome (And FFv39) all work. Are you sure you using IE and not Edge? By default, Win uses Edge. You'll need to change that as Edge is not supported.</div>
