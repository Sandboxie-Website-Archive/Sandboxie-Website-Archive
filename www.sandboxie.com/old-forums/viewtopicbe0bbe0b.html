				<div class="content">Hello, <br>
i need help to understand how to handle this situation I have with Sandboxie. <br>
<br>
I made it so that everything launched from Harddisc "E" is started with Sandboxie. That works really nice for testing stuff but here is my problem, i try to describe it. <br>
If i open a<strong> .jpg</strong> file it will also be opend in a Sandboxie started ACD See, even if ACD See is installed on Harddisc "C". <br>
But if i right-click the .jpg file and select "<em>open with</em>" and then select ACD See it will be opened in a normal ACD See that is not started in Sandboxie. <br>
I dont know why and it does not matter, it works that way and its perfect to load pictures faster. <br>
<br>
But how can i handle this if i want to <strong>ZIP</strong> some files on the harddsic? If i select the files, and select 7-zip, add to xxx.zip it starts the zipping process with Sandboxie.<br>
Even if i start 7-zip in advance outside the Sandbox, as soon as I select the files from Harddisc "E" it starts the zipping process again with Sandboxie. <br>
Keeping in mind how the opening with ACD See works outside Sandboxie, is there also a workaround for zipping files in that situation? <br>
<br>
Thanks for the help.</div>
