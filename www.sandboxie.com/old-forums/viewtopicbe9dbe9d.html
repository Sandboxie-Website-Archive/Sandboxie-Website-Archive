				<div class="content">I don't want to beat a dead horse with a stick, but I swear I cannot find an answer to this.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I want to type Japanese in my webbrowser (both Chrome and IE does not work.)  I can switch my lanugage and it works find in the URL, or any other program.  However, if I try to type Japanese in a text box (for example, in the Google search box), it does not work at all.<br>
<br>
Also note, if I run Chrome or IE not in Sandboxie, it works fine.  It only happens while in Sandboxie.  All my Sandboxie preferences are default.<br>
<br>
I believe it has something to do with Resource Access....but I have no idea.  Has anyone had this problem? <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> <br>
<br>
I am running Windows 7 Professional 64-bit.</div>

				<div class="content">Sorry, Version is 4.01.07 (64-bit) Here are some screen shots.<br>
In the first image the cursor is in the search box, but cannot select Japanese.<br>
In the second image, as soon as I move the cursor in the URL box, it works fine.  Again, everything works fine, just not in Sandboxie.<br>

				<div class="content">Hi thanks for trying to help me.  Ok...<br>
<br>
If not already installed, in optional window update you will find an area to install other keyboards.  But you probably already have it installed.<br>
<br>
Control Panel &gt; Region and Language &gt; Keyboards and Languages &gt; General Tab &gt; Add...<br>
Then select the IME.  Here's a pic.<br>

				<div class="content">I spent some time with this issue today, but no solution yet.  As far as I can tell this affects Internet Explorer (haven't checked Chrome) but it does not affect other programs, like Notepad or the Run Any Program dialog box for example.  Can you confirm this is the same for you?  That only a few select programs are not able to enter input in Japanese?</div>

				<div class="content">Yes I can confirm that the problem happens in Chrome as well.  When I go home tonight, I will check if I can reproduce the problems in other programs that have text boxes (like a PDF file with a text box, etc.) and report back with my findings.  But thanks for working on the problem.  I bought my wife a new computer and want her to try Sandboxie.  Before, she would get lots of viruses (the computer kind).  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">  So I hope you can figure out a solution.  Until then....she is not allowed to touch the new computer. *lol*</div>

				<div class="content">And if you run Notepad under Sandboxie instead of a browser, does IME work correctly for you?<br>
For me, IME works correctly in Notepad, but fails in the browser.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi tzuk,<br>
Sorry for the late reply, I was out sick.  Anyways, yes, it works for everything, mainly does not work for Chrome and Internet explorer.  I just tried opening a PDF file with a built in form...when it also did not work.<br>
<br>
I'm guessing it probably won't work with all programs that have a text box?</div>
