Hello Craig@Invincea<br>
Thank you for posting above comments.   I've always had NIS/NAV/N360 listed with Applications and Compatibility.<br>
So, I've always assumed SBIE focus was toward Norton compatibility. <br>
I've even posted several times about when SBIE focus would include Norton Security not understanding SBIE compatibility criteria eg: major 3rd party programs (Office suites, 3-4 major Browsers, etc..) <br>
SBIE breaking Norton Toolbar is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> a deal breaker.  And now that I have an appreciation of SBIE compatibility focus and why SBIE breaks Toolbar.  <br>
Well, thanks for helping me luv SBIE even more.   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>
Regards</div>

We've tried to get more AV suites to work and play nicely. But as they add more and more features and they require more ways to communicate outside the SB or within the OS, it defeats the purpose of SBIE. so it's a catch 22. Tools bars in general have been problematic for sometime with SBIE versions.<br>
<br>
Once Win 10 settles down and these products settle down as well, we can see what can be done!<br>
<br>
The question I ask the Devs...do you see  reason to have AV running in a sandbox? Basic AV I can see...the bells and whistles are the headache. So we try to have "basic" level of compatibility.<br>
<br>
My goal is to also update and keep updated the compatibility listed online. It's woefully out of date. Maybe some crowd sourcing as well..</div>
