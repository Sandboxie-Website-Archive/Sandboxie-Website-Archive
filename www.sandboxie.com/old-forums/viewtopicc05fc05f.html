				<div class="content">Hi tzuk<br>
I think you've done a really great job with Sandboxie,it's light on my resources it's not slowing down my browsing either ,I hope you get a little more recognition for your efforts than you have done so far because you thoroughly deserve it for this software.<br>
I'm just wondering if you could explain a bit about what's happening in the registry under HKey Users /sandbox?<br>
<br>
Thanks again<br>
<br>
regards<br>
Kaupp<br>

About the registry:<br>
<br>
Sandboxie must always be able to give the sandboxed process a usable registry key.  Even if the was created by a sandboxed process, and it doesn't exist outside the sandbox, the process should still be given a key object to work with.  The HKCU\Sandbox subtree is used to give processes dummy key objects for keys that they think exist, but in fact do not.<br>
<br>
Currently what happens is that for EVERY key accessed by a sandboxed process, a corresponding dummy key is built under the HKCU\Sandbox key.  That probably isn't necessary, but that's how it works right now.  It doesn't seem to incur a horrible overhead, so I won't mess with it for the time being.   They say if it's not broken, don't fix it.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>
