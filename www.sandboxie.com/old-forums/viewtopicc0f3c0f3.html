				<h3>Happy (early) valentines SBIE</h3>

				<div class="content">I remember the first time I saw your GUI.<br>
I thought for sure the program was made by a newbie.<br>
You were so ugly and foul.<br>
I felt like I should growl.<br>
I hate your pizza icon.<br>
It looks like it was drawn with a crayon.<br>
You were so different.<br>
I never thought you'd get my endorsement.<br>
You were so confusing.<br>
You, I did not think I would keep using.<br>
How was I supposed to like you?<br>
I really did devalue.<br>
I almost threw you away.<br>
Instead I gave you another day.<br>
I started testing and hoping you would fail.<br>
That way I could finally exhale.<br>
I gave it everything I had.<br>
Yet your protections were iron clad.<br>
At first I was truly sad.<br>
Then slowly I became glad.<br>
I don't remember when I first began to feel love.<br>
Maybe it happened once I realized you fit like a glove.<br>
So many of the things I always wanted my security to be.<br>
You are very nearly the perfect sentry.<br>
When I look at you I still want to shriek.<br>
But I love how much there is to tweak.<br>
If you'll pardon my candor.<br>
I hope Sophos doesn't put you in amber.<br>
I want to see you next valentine.<br>
Even if about you I love to whine.</div>
