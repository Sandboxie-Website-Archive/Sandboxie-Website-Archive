If you are using a non restricted sandbox or if you are using a restricted sandbox and you PDFs runs within the browser, do same steps as if you were not using Sandboxie. No difference.<br>
<br>
If you are using a restricted sandbox and your PDF Reader runs out of the browser, then you need to allow the PDF Readers exe to run (add the exe in Start/Run Sandbox restrictions).<br>
