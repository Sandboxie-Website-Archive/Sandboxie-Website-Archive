				<h3>Solution to Dota 2 and other steam games from Win 10 Creator error</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sun Jan 14, 2018 10:06 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Cyvene</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Hello, it's been months since I encountered this problem and previously the only fix is to revert back to basic version of Windows 10 while disabling any updates or just not use Windows 10 at all. But now I've upgraded my card from GTX 970 to 1080 Ti and there's no way the card will work unless I updated and I do not wish to downgrade to older Windows.<br>
<br>
So after scratching my head and forced to deal with this problem once more, I've finally came up with a solution and it's a simple one :<br>
<br>
- Run Steam Sandboxed<br>
- Instead of pressing the play button on Dota 2 in Steam, open your Sandboxie again<br>
- Run the game you want manually by browsing the .exe file within the same Sandbox as the Steam you opened (Right Click Sandbox &gt; Run Sandboxed &gt; Run Any Program). In the case of Dota 2 64 bit, it's in : C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\bin\win64<br>
- Enjoy the game you want once more.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps everyone who spend hours stuck on finding the solution!</div>

<br>
None of the steps provided in this thread work at all.<br>
<br>
Whoever marked this thread as solved should be aware that this is NOT solved.<br>
<br>
Currently the only way to fix this, is to downgrade your current Windows 10 to version 1607, however you may require your Win 10 bootable cd/dvd/usb during that process.</div>

				<div class="content">Here's what worked for me:<br>
<br>
1) Set compatibility for dota.exe 32bit to Win8, it's under settings and the 2nd tab<br>
2) launch steam sandbox as per normal<br>
3) then go to the directory where dota.exe is located (same 32 bit) and run that one sandboxed<br>
<br>
No mor issue with "file appears to be missing " or "different server files" bullshet.  I think valve is trying to fuk with us.</div>
