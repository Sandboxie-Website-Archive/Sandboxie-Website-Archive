				<h3>Security bulletins and notification via e-mail</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Wed Aug 13, 2014 1:33 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>cornflake</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I would like security bulletins and to receive notification of them via e-mail. For example if something in Sandboxie is vulnerable I would like it if you could e-mail me. I am already a customer and you have my e-mail. I have several computers and on many of them I don't plan to update Sandboxie unless the version I'm using is vulnerable. I've found it difficult to figure out what version, if any, is vulnerable. I posted a related question here:<br>
<a href="viewtopic7c847c84.php?f=17&amp;t=19407" class="postlink">I'm using Sandboxie 4.08. Is that version still secure?</a><br>
<br>
Thanks</div>

For now, I would advise you to regularly check the Change logs <a href="../indexbe25-2.html?VersionChanges" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/?VersionChanges</a> And monitor the forum. If it's something major, it'll be posted here first. We don't maintain a list of user emails.</div>

Thanks for your reply. Even if you don't maintain a user list you could make one. You have my e-mail associated with my license for example, and also you have my e-mail associated with my account on this forum. Or you could just make a separate list and have a form where people could sign up. I really think it's a lot to do to have to go through the forum posts to find the latest security issue. I'm just not going to do that every day although I do check the forums occasionally. If you had a bulletin with the latest information, and I received an e-mail notification, we could react to that much faster. That could even be done in a master thread that any forum user could subscribe to. You lock the thread and then each time a security issue is found you update the thread with details of the issue and workarounds,etc.</div>

A security thread is an idea. As for the emails we collect. Yes, we have it from the forum registrations and Cleverbridge would have it from the orders from licensing.</div>
