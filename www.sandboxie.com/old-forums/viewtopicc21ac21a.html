				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I use sandboxie in everything and it's very very helpful but i have some suggestions could help in enhancements to the software<br>
<br>
1. in "Set Layout and Groups" window, when i have long list its hard for me to move a sandbox from bottom to top by (press right click -&gt; move up) everytime.<br>
my solution to put small arrows in the side of the window Up and Down. check attachment named "1.png".<br>
<br>
2. in "Create a New Sandbox" window, in enter a name for new sandbox should add label beside showing the length of the name i entered. check attachment named "2.png".<br>
other solution lock the name when it reach to 32 digit.<br>
<br>
3. in "Run Sandboxed" window, what if i want to quickly run any software or game and want to make a new sandbox for it, i have to open Sandboxie Control -&gt; sandbox tab -&gt; Create new sandbox.<br>
my solution to run game or software by press "Run sandboxed" and select ("Create new sandbox") this should ask for the name of the new sandbox and create a new sandbox and run it. check attachment named "3.png".<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time.<br>
