<br>
How do I arrange it so that Sandboxie does not automatically start when I boot the PC? Specifically, I have disabled the "Start Sandboxie Control" when Windows starts, but when I run certain programs, they are Sandboxed. These programs, or at least one of them as I can see, are included in the Sandboxie Protected Programs list (which I have created for testing purposes). I can only presume that Sandboxie starts at startup somehow, but I do not see where to disable this setting.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello cocoon,<br>
<br>
If you have a forced program, it will invoke Sandboxie when you try launch it.  The Sandboxie service is involved and turning it off will cause the program to error out (as it won't be able to get to Sandboxie).<br>
Your options are to remove that program from the forced programs list, run the program outside Sandboxie or temporarily disable forced programs:<br>
<br>
To run a forced program outside Sandboxie, right click on the program --&gt; Run Sandboxed --&gt; Run outside Sandbox  <br>
OR<br>
Hold ctrl + shift , right click on the application --&gt; Run Sandboxed. <br>
<br>
To disable Forced Programs: <br>
Sandboxie Control --&gt; File ---&gt; Disable Forced Programs<br>
Select the amount of time (in seconds) that you'd like to disable them for. <br>
Once you have set the time, you can right-click on the Sandboxie Control icon in the taskbar and select "disable force programs". <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>
