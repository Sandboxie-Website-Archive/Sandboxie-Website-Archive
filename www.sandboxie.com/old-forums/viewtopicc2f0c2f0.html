				<h3>Sandboxie Settings Question [SOLVED]</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Mon Nov 06, 2017 10:43 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Grenpara</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I am writing to ask a question but first present some facts.<br>
<br>
I have Sandboxie, Kaspersky &amp; Malwarebytes and on top of that use multiple free online virus scanners.<br>
About a week ago I got infected with a virus that none of my protection caught and somehow it made it out of sandboxie.<br>
It encrypted one user account and then deleted system restore points and then totally locked Windows 8.1.<br>
<br>
My computer repair store and I could not recover windows and I was forced to swap drive and reinstall Windows 8.1 64bit.<br>
The other drive was low level formatted and is now a spare in a box.<br>
<br>
Now my question(s):<br>
<br>
What settings should Sandboxie be set too to avoid having this problem again?<br>
I do not know what virus it was or how long it was on the system but I assume it infected me 2 weeks to a month ago.<br>
I would like to be protected and i have never had this issue before with all my protection.<br>
i do know from reading some forums others have had similar virus that was not caught, thou they were not using sandboxie or if they were they never mentioned it.<br>
<br>
I use virustotal and Jotti's online virus file scan and they also never detected anything with any of the files I have tried in recent weeks.<br>
<br>
So how can I better restrict programs run in sandboxie?<br>
would it be safer to use vmware and install windows there and then install sandboxie on Windows os in vmware?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance<br>
Gren</div>

				<div class="content">Grenpara, malware doesn't get out of the sandbox unless you recover it. You could restrict the sandbox but either way, using a restricted sandbox or a default settings sandbox, malware doesn't get out.You have to do it yourself. Perhaps you ran an installer unsandboxed that came with malware.<br>

Hey Bo,<br>
<br>
Thanks for the fast reply to my post, I really appreciate it.<br>
I understand what you are saying but I am pretty sure about it. But if you say it can't get out that leaves me a followup question.<br>
If I ran a program in Sandbox like normally and it uses internet could the program send something to a site and then at some point the site gains access to my network to infect the system?<br>
<br>
I have no idea how I got infected or exactly when as the drive files/windows was to screwed up to recover anything as i could not even fix Windows with the Windows 8.1 disk. I am currently trying to get all my software keys reset so I can start installing my software again as I had lost a lot as I did not make a recent backup. (which should not happen again,)<br>
<br>
Anyways thanks for the info and help.<br>

Without information regarding which file escaped the Sandbox (if any), we cannot test nor verify that this is a Sandboxie issue.  <br>
If you could gather more details and provide repro steps, I should be able to test them. <br>
<br>
Please, have a look at these threads regarding restricting sandbox access, as well as preventing ransomware:<br>

Hello Barb,<br>
<br>
Thanks for the information and reply, I appreciate it.<br>
<br>
As for the program I dont have a clue i download 30 programs a day to play with and see if i like.<br>
I get from Softpedia, Cnet.com and many others.<br>
I am pretty sure it was a file search utility but really dont remember, I have spent a week trying to get my system working and had to have a shop reinstall windows. It was put on a new drive and I have been installing programs back since yesterday.<br>
<br>
I will keep better track of what I install when i dont know it, but I had expected Kaspersky, Malwarebytes, Jottie's and Virus Total to alert me to bad programs. And none of them flagged anything  and as said I run in sandboxie first just to make sure. Thou not all things will run in Sandboxie but I am sure in the last few weeks everything was run first in Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
Anyways thanks for the help and info.<br>
If I remember the program or I recall the name if I see it again I will post about it.<br>
Thanks again<br>
Gren</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I have a followup issue maybe.<br>
So I would like to know if sandboxie allows firefox to bypass it?<br>
<br>
What I mean is I notice if I have firefox sandboxed and lets say I have a bunch of tabs open.<br>
Then if I right click a tab and say bookmark all tabs and create a folder name and hit ok.<br>
Then I right click sandboxie and terminate and then delete contents of sandboxie.<br>
<br>
Now if I open firefox not sandboxed I will see a new folder [New Folder] in bookmarks list and inside it is all the tabs i bookmarked during sandboxie use but never recovered. So how is it that the bookmarks are saved if I did not  use recover for them in sandboxie?<br>
Is this normal and if it is not normal can this be happening with other files?<br>
<br>
If you do not believe me I can make a video showing you eveything I do so you can see they are being saved outside of sandboxie.<br>
<br>
Please let me know.<br>
Thanks in advance<br>
Gren</div>

The bookmarks are being saved out of the sandbox because you are allowing access to bookmarks or the Firefox profile in Sandbox settings&gt;Applications&gt;Web browser&gt;Firefox.<br>
<br>
If you uncheck those settings, bookmarks will not be saved.<br>
