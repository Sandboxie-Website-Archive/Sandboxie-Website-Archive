Kareldjag has done many thorough tests on quite a few security apps and is an expert.This is what he/she has to say about Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
Regarding the latest WMF exploit.<br>

A web content filter can be used in combination with a sandbox: in this case, SandBoxie is a highly recommended product.<br>
<br>
SandBoxie limits risks of infections and also limitâ€™s the impact of some attacks.<br>
<br>
If someone try to install a rookit remotely, the rootkit will not able to run.<br>
<br>
And the result is the same if we try to install a rootkit under SandBoxie: rights and privileges under SandBoxie are limited:<br>
<br>
With the OSR crash utility which requires administrator privileges, we can see that the system is about to crash, but in fact, Sandboxie blocks the action.<br>
<br>
Personal HIPS are the most important anti-rootkit defense after the firewall.<br>
<br>
Many of them have the ability to detect service/driver installation which are often required for rootkits.<br>
<br>
Moreover, theses Desktop IPS operate at a low level and acts as a service associated with a kernel driver.</div>
