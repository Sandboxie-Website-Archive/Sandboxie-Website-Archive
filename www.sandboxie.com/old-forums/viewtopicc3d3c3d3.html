				<div class="content">This is just for info as I am not looking for a fix right now. I just tried SB 5.23 Beta 3 but got "The bookmarks and history system will not be functional" error message at the top of the browser window (as a red warning) and clicking on Learn More took me to this page <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/fix-bookmarks-and-history-will-not-be-functional?redirectlocale=en-US&amp;as=u&amp;redirectslug=The+bookmarks+and+history+system+will+not+be+functional&amp;utm_source=inproduct" class="postlink">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/fi ... =inproduct</a><br>
<br>
Rather than go through the procedures shown, I reverted to SB 5.22 and the problem was corrected.<br>
<br>
Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit<br>
MS Security Essentials<br>
SB 5.34 Beta 3<br>
Firefox 57.0.4<br>
There were no SB error messages</div>

<br>
No changes made to Sbie 5.23.3 should affect Firefox directly. The only change in that build is added compatibility for Windows 7 x64 + latest security patches for the kernel. <br>
<br>
Please have a look at the existing threads for your reported issue: (they are old, but might help you figure out the root cause of the problem)<br>

				<div class="content">I had reverted to SB 5.22 and all was well, especially after I did a file system check sfc /scannow and a number of corrupted system files were fixed (solving another issue).  Then I decided to try SB 5.23-3 again and got the same bookmark issue when I opened the browser in the default Sandbox (see the attached screenshot), but when I ran FF outside the sandbox, I did not encounter this error. I then opened the FF browser in a new, clean sandbox, but no error. I then tried another sandbox and again got no error about the bookmarks., I am going to try deleting the contents of the default sandbox to see if that fixes the problem.<br>

Deleting the contents of the default sandbox solved the problem, as I can see the bookmarks and history again.</div>
