				<div class="content">Hi there,<br>
<br>
I have a program called 'Remote Mouse' (<a href="http://www.remotemouse.net/" class="postlink">http://www.remotemouse.net/</a>) installed on my machine. There is a function within it to display a QR code which it does so by loading a web page within Chrome. I have Chrome set as a forced program to run within a sandbox. However some how Chrome is opened outside of a sandbox and Sandboxie hasnt even warned me. <br>
<br>
This feels very unsafe to me and i'm not sure how 'Remote Mouse' has circumvented Sandboxie  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>
<br>
That instance of Chrome that is loaded also seems different to a normal instance:
<ul><li>It does not stack on the task bar with other Chrome instances</li></ul>
<ul><li>It does not use the Chrome icon</li></ul>
<ul><li>It does however get listed in process list with nothing seemingly wrong other than that the User Name it is running under is blank</li> </ul>

Would very much like to determine how something like this could happen and if its a security risk.<br>
<br>
Thanks for any help in advance</div>
