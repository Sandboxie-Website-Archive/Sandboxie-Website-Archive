				<h3>SBIE2224 Opera crash</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sun Mar 11, 2018 10:06 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
For the last few days, I have been getting these popups everytime when I launch Opera browser (sandboxed): <br>
<br>
Popup from Sandboxie: <blockquote class="uncited"><div>SBIE2224 Sandboxed program has crashed: opera.exe [DefaultBox]</div></blockquote>

Popup from Windows(?):  <blockquote class="uncited"><div>opera.exe - Erreur d'application ; "L'exception unknow software exception (0xc0000409) s'est produite dans l'application Ã  l'emplacement 0x011ffdab. Cliquez sur OK pour terminer le programme.</div></blockquote>

This issue did not start to occur following any program update. I had been using Opera version 51.0.2830.40 with Sandboxie 5.23.3 for a while without any problem.<br>
<br>
Here is what I did so far to try to resolve the issue:<br>
<br>
1.  I completely uninstalled Opera (e.g. deleting user settings) and reinstalled the newly released version 51.0.2830.55<br>
<br>
2.  I uninstalled Sandboxie (deleted user settings) and upgraded to version 5.24 (release candidate)<br>
<br>
At first, it seemed to have resolved the issue, but as soon as I rebooted my PC, the same issue came back again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Additional information: <br>
<br>
O.S.: Windows 7 x64<br>
<br>
Antivirus:  Webroot SecureAnywhere 9.0.19.43 (I have been running this build for several weeks without any issue with Sandboxie)<br>
<br>
Any other info or logs I can submit?<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
<br>
p.s.: This issue does not occur with the most recent versions of Firefox (version 58.0.2), Chrome (Version 65.0.3325.146), and Internet Explorer (version 11.0.96.00.18920)</div>

Does Opera work fine outside Sandboxie ? <br>
Are you using any extensions? <br>
Have you tried creating a new Sandbox with default settings? <br>
<br>
Regarding WebRoot, here's the lastes info he got in our dedicated AV Software. Give these workarounds a go:<br>

				<div class="content">Hello Barb,<br>
<br>
To answer your questions:<br>
<br>
1. Yes, Opera does work perfectly fine outside Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
2. Yes, I am using two extensions in Opera: LastPass and Adblock Plus. I deactivated them and then launched Opera again in Sandboxie: the same issue persists.  (Please note that I am also using the same extensions in Firefox... with no issue like with Opera)<br>
<br>
3. I did create a new Sandbox with defaults settings: the same popups/error messages are showing up repeatedly when I launch Opera.<br>
<br>
4. Regarding Webroot SecureAnywhere:<br>
<br>
After looking at the thread that you invited me to read, I tried the following workaround: under 'Identity Protection', I did set opera.exe to <strong>Allow</strong> instead of <strong>Protected</strong> (by default, Webroot sets all browsers to <strong>Protected</strong>). Result: The same issue persisted. So, I set opera.exe back to <strong>Protected</strong>. <br>
<br>
I also did a clean reinstall of Webroot (which I believe was not mentioned in the thread), and it didn't change anything either.<br>
<br>
Anything else I should try?<br>
<br>
Regards</div>

<br>
Test if the issue goes away completely when you remove Webroot. <br>
If yes, then start disabling settings in it to see if you can find out which one is causing the problem. <br>
<br>
Also you post the results of Resource Access Monitor and I'll take a look. Not sure we'll find much there since the app crashes right away,  but I'll check it out.<br>
<a href="../ResourceAccessMonitor.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/ResourceAccessMonitor</a><br>
Repro the issue, paste the output.<br>
Highlight your pasted output and hit the "&lt;/&gt;" button to format it please.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
