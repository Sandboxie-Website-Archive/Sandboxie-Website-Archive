I say 'pretty sure' because it works as well as installed.  But on my old pc I had a folder of my username under c:\sandbox and I think with portable I only have a DefaultBox folder there.</div>

"hive path err" is related to "RegHive" file that wasn't able to be load by SandboxDiff. There are several reasons for, that you can check:<br>
<br>
. When starting the sandbox folder is empty; so "RegHive" file didn't exist to be analyzed. You need to do a dummy action to create it: e.g. open Notepad.exe sandboxed and close it. Start SandboxDiff after.<br>
<br>
. "RegHive" file was in use perhaps. You need to terminate all app. that are sandboxed firstly (when is asked by SandboxDiff).</div>

When you have "hive path err" SandboxDiff was unable to load "RegHive" file for some reason.<br>
BTW, do you have "UserPath.bat" customized?<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Anonymous wrote:</cite>Anyway, if I run sandboxdiff before, during, or after a sandboxed app, it is not finding any reghive file which is at C:\Sandbox\DefaultBox</div></blockquote>
Can you describe in detail the steps that you do when install an app. sandboxed with SandboxDiff? I think that can allow a clarification.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Anonymous wrote:</cite>I was able to see when the hive.bak files were being created I could peek in one that said HKEY_USERS hive or something...my reghive created when looked at in wrr starts with \Sandbox_&lt;MyUserName_DefaultBox.</div></blockquote>
No annoyance here. I can explain better further along (it's a form issue not a content question).   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"><br>
<br>
BTW, WRR shows the registry status; SandboxDiff performs the registry changes between two status.</div>

				<div class="content">Well I have tried many different orders of operations now, including messing with the path declaration, but no avail.<br>
<br>
My user path<br>
C:\Sandbox\DefaultBox<br>
<br>
My userpath line<br>
copy "C:\Sandbox\DefaultBox\RegHive" hive_1.bak /v /y &gt; NUL<br>
<br>
1. Sandbox "delete contents"<br>
2. SandboxDiff.exe (re-read instructions see if i'm missing something)<br>
3. Press OK<br>
(3.a.) Maybe look at Reg_before and see hive path err, continue anyway<br>
4. Pick an app, right click, "run sandboxed"<br>
5. Right click Sandboxie Control, pick "Terminate all programs"<br>
6. SandboxDiff press "OK"<br>
<br>
1d0<br>
&lt; hive path err<br>
\ No newline at end of file<br>
<br>
Same results if a RegHive exists or folder is empty.<br>
<br>
But also like I said my hive file key starts with Sandbox_Username_DefaultBox even though I have not set it to use a username<br>
My Sandboxie config is %SystemDrive%\Sandbox\%SANDBOX%<br>
<br>
<br>
I do not see a regdump.exe anywhere on my system.  I have an nlited XP install.<br>
<br>
Thank you so much if you can explain</div>

				<div class="content">Please try follows the sequence (notes in red):<br>
<br>
- The "UserPath.bat" file (don't forget to rename "UserPath.bat.txt" to "UserPath.<strong>bat</strong>") needs to be in same folder that "SandboxDiff.exe". With your customized path:   copy "C:\Sandbox\DefaultBox\RegHive" hive_1.bak /v /y &gt; NUL<br>
<br>
1. Sandbox "delete contents" <span style="color: red">--&gt; When you do this you removes "RegHive" file also! ("C:\Sandbox\DefaultBox\RegHive") - Please add step 1A- and 1B<br>
1A- Run Notepad.exe sandboxed. Close it after - so none app. is running sandboxed now. (this allows to create a "RegHive").<br>
1B- Check if a "RegHive" is in "C:\Sandbox\DefaultBox". It should be.</span><br>
2. SandboxDiff.exe (re-read instructions see if i'm missing something) <br>
3. Press OK <br>
(3.a.) Maybe look at Reg_before and see hive path err, continue anyway <br>
4. <span style="color: darkred">Pick an app, right click, "run sandboxed"</span> <span style="color: red">--&gt; Don't do this step. For now <span style="text-decoration: underline">don't run</span> any app. sandboxed.</span><br>
5. Right click Sandboxie Control, pick "Terminate all programs" <br>
6. SandboxDiff press "OK" <br>
<br>
Please post the text that it is in "<span style="text-decoration: underline">Comp-Reg.txt</span>" file.<br>
<br>
Obs.: When you want work with SandboxDiff, you don't need to "delete contents". But if you do that you need to do a dummy action before (e.g. open/close Notepad), to create the "RegHive" file.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks so much for sharing your work and not getting mad at me, this functions very well and is so useful.   I do think that the instructions could be written a little bit more clear for dumber users like me, that an initial RegHive must be created first, through, for example, the 'notepad sandbox'.<br>

so now how will we save the world economy next?</div>
