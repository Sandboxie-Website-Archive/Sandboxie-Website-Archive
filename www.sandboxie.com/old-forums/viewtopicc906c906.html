				<div class="content">I think that is a good idea for adding some presets into sandboxie. For example :<br>
1) web security - best setting for security when browsing via browsers( firefox, opera, chrome, ie, safari). Only browser get acces to web. I understand that i can do it manually( forced apps for browsers, and block any ethernet activity for any other programms) excepted browsers. but it will be useful for regular user.<br>
2) malicious activity - blocked any ethernet activity and acces activity for unknow apps. it will be useful for any unknow applications.<br>
3) banking activity - maximaze security of  any banking operations via iexplorer. it's will be useful if you will add virtual keyboard  for blocking keyloggers activity if it possible.</div>

<br>
Thank you for your feedback. <br>
<br>
Here are a few things that might help (although, not presets): <br>
<br>
1 - We have Firefox and IE tips:<br>
<a href="../FirefoxTips.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/FirefoxTips</a><br>
<a href="../InternetExplorerTips.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/InternetExplorerTips</a><br>
<br>
2- I am not sure I fully understand what you are requesting. Sandboxie is not an Antivirus, but you can use it along with an AV in order to scan for malicious apps.  Please see : <a href="viewtopica271a271.html?p=111707#p111707" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?p=111707#p111707</a><br>
<br>
3- Have a look at my response here, which contains useful links from users that shared their secure setups:<br>
<a href="viewtopic49aa49aa.html?p=128539#p128539" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?p=128539#p128539</a><br>
Have a look at this entry regarding privacy:<br>

				<div class="content">1. All tips as you provided is not what i am waiting for. As you know in your tips for Firefox or Iexplore, the basic setting allow to any other programm running at sandboxie to get full acces to web. but in my opinion - this tips must exclude any acces to web for all programms excluding firefox or iexplore. <br>
2. i meant setting to full isolated enviroment for unknow programms. no acces to web, no acces for any other ponential risk features.<br>
3.  Links are useful, but it will be more useful if you will make presets for beginner users, who dont understand all this.<br>
Your programm is good, but in my opinion a little improvements for simplify the use of your programm will be useful for usual users. So presets maybe not bad idea, and i dont think that it to hard for realising.</div>

				<div class="content">will you plan to adding support for some application that requires drivers. is it possible? for example acronis, or some web wyswyg programms(like templatetoaster, artisteer),and some virtual machine(virtualbox, thinapp).also a good idea to make sandboxie started by default for unknow programms, like realised in comodo sandbox, it prompts to run unknow programm in sandbox.</div>

<br>
Thanks for your feedback/suggestions. <br>
<br>
Installing drivers is outside the scope of Sandboxie. You may want to consider using a VM for that purpose.<br>
Here's a related thread that may be useful:<br>
<a href="viewtopicf364f364.html?p=89230#p89230" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?p=89230#p89230</a><br>
<br>
Regarding your second question, Sandboxie cannot tell which programs are "unknown". It is not an Antivirus but an isolation environment. <br>
If you are unsure about a program, you may want to consider forcing your downloads folder to be Sandboxed, that way you have a safety net if you forget to right-click ---&gt;run sandboxed when downloading/testing files/programs.<br>
<br>

				<div class="content">ok! but another sandbox by comodo do this. So Maybe is it possible for realising this functionality in newer versions? The main reason why i bought your product - it's possibility run any programms in isolated enviroment. Without any antivirus soft excluding Windows defender, this is main reason why i dont use comodo antivirus. I hope that your devs will find the way how to run programms with drivers in sandboxie. There are a lot programms with required drivers - acronis, artisteer, templatetoaster, kompass 3d, some product from graphisoft and autodesk, and they leave traces in windows registry, what slow down overall system perfomance in future. So adding this functionality may do better your programm. i hope you are understanding  the reason why i wrote all this.  If any users from forum think in the same direction as i - please write your comments here.</div>
