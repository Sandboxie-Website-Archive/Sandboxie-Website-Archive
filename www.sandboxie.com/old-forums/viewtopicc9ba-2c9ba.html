				<div class="content">Life would be more easy if there is a "learning mode" with sadboxie. <br>
<br>
Say, I can run a program in the learning mode, using it as usual, when the application need some access permission, sandboxie pop-up a window, request me allow this access, and remember my selection to corresponding configuration item (File/Registry/IPC/Window/COM access, etc.).<br>
<br>
With this powerful tool, we could setup an app to the sandboxie easily, A lot of manually analysis could be avoided.<br>

Asbai, don't complicate yourself. My recommendation: use Sandboxie on default settings,  make changes to settings as you learn what each setting is about and how they affect programs running in the sandbox. Sandboxies default settings are very powerful. How do I know that? pretty much everyone that I know in real life who is using Sandboxie is using a default settings sandbox and dont get infected anymore. Most of this people don't ever go into settings. <br>
<br>
Enjoy Sandboxie and take your time learning it.<br>

A well-implemented "learning mode" would save us a lot of time. <br>
Even those who work very closely with Sandboxie for many years. Just think of the many possible manual settings in the "Sandboxie.ini"<br>
<br>
Undoubtedly, it would a real asset to Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
What do you Alan and Curt @ invincea think about it?</div>

<br>
First I agree with Bo.   Secondly if you truly understand how  Sandboxie works, you would see why it's almost impossible.   For example, in programs today that to have learning modes, they simply make rules for what they see happen.   So how would a sandboxie learning mode know, I don't want certain areas of my disk accessed.   It can't.<br>

Imagine sandboxie asking you "This program tries to write x bytes to c:\blah blah blah, do you want to allow it?" "This program tries to create a registry key in HKCU\SOFTWARES\blah blah blah, do you want to allow it?" and breaks execution 1145148108931919 times when you install a large program inside sandboxie.</div>
