				<div class="content">It's not so simple regarding that MS Issue.<br>
<br>
As for beta's....<br>
And beta's are rolled up into Stable releases once they'v been tested. <br>
We can't keep spamming end users with update notifications. We actually get complaints about that now and we only do stable releases every 4 months or so.  Once a Stable is released, everyone use SBIE is notified. <br>
<br>
End users are not notified of beta builds.<br>
<br>
It's up to the end user to check the forums and change logs to see what we've fixed. You can go beta.sandboxie.com and look.</div>

Sandboxie 5.13.5 doesn't appear to block that MS issue.  As Craig says above, it's not so simple I guess.</div>

We do not test Steam. <br>
<strong>Games like that are to be installed ON YOUR host &amp; then (possibly) run as sandboxed. </strong> This is the recommended Sandboxie way &amp; has been for over a year.<br>
We do not guarantee any program will install into the SB. While that is a feature, it was never a core intention and cannot apply to games that require unfeathered resources on the host. <br>
There is no way around that. <br>
The Trust no program doesn't mean Steam games. <br>
If you're paying and using a legitimate service, there is nothing to not trust.<br>
<br>
We are not currently looking at any fixes for Steam. The Steam client works, Steam detects SBIE as a cheat program. We haven't tested Steam or updated SBIE directly for Steam use in over a year. At the moment, that's simply not on our roadmap.</div>

Games like that being installed on my host would leave files laying around I want GONE once I get rid of the game, hence why I keep it in sandboxie and wipe it once in a while. And by your accounts you'd be saying windows 10 which is a service you now pay for and a legitimate service in the eyes of many yet has backdoors into the system*known* and it by default has set to share your bandwidth for updates to other people*also known* that is something that makes windows 10 untrustworthy to me yet you'd call it perfectly trustworthy? Hmm I see now how you guys a security company operates.</div>

				<div class="content">There seems to be a problem with launching unknown executables from sandboxed Explorer window with SmartScreen on.<br>
Windows 10 1607 Enterprise LTSB x64, fresh install of SBIE 5.13.5 with default settings. Haven't tried 5.12.<br>
I've downloaded an unknown executable via Google Chrome, opened a sandboxed Windows Explorer window and tried to execute the file. smartscreen.exe is launched in the sandbox, but nothing appears, just a "busy" cursor. When you try manipulating the Explorer window it will hang.<br>
Anyone else?</div>

<br>
I am using Firefox 48.0.1 along with Sandboxie 5.13.5 on Windows 10.<br>
<br>
What I find is that Firebox is slow to boot up and slow to exit from Sandboxie. (Just measured 23 seconds to shut down. (spits on pizza icon disappear).<br>
<br>
Appreciate some help in improving bootup and exit.<br>
<br>
thanks<br>

Yes, the same problem here with Windows 10 1607 and Sandboxie 5.12 and 5.13.5. <br>
Before the Windows Update (with 1511) the link passing from TB -&gt; FF worked fine also when both running in a sandbox.</div>

Is this problem specific to TB? I.e., should I add an open "{3480A401-BDE9-4407-BC02-798A866AC051} ShellServiceHostBrokerProvider" to the TB template?</div>
