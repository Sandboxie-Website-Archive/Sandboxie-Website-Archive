				<div class="content">This would be a great addition IMHO. It will give the advanced user more convenience, because its easier to whitelist access to sthg then having to black list access to everything else in a directory except the desired subfolder. I remember it was discussed a year before and Tzuk said he will add it but not at that time.<br>
<br>
Tzuk can you please give this consideration?<br>
<br>
Many Thanks</div>

I think you're mistaken.<br>
<br>
This request usually comes up in the context of Blocked Access paths.<br>
<br>
I.e. block access to D:\ except D:\Programs.  Or something like that.<br>
<br>
My response has always been that this is a complicated change to the way Sandboxie works and I am not going to do it.<br>
<br>
Sorry.</div>

That's exactly the line I was thinking along in the discussion with SSJ and Ruhe yesterday.  That would be a great feature but if it's not to be it's not to be.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the update, Tzuk.  Sandboxie remains my single best piece of software for peace of mind.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the clarification Tzuk. I had no idea how difficult it is to add such a thing; its not worth it for such a 'bells and whistles' feature. Sandboxie is amazing as it is and remains the bulwark of my security setup. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool">  <br>
