				<h3>Sandboxie blocks some media files from playing in Opera browser</h3>

				<div class="content">Seems like Sandboxie and MFDemuxer used in Opera browser have compatibility issues.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Running Opera sandboxied</span><br>
When MFDemuxer is enabled in Opera browser, some media files cannot be played due to error of loading, for example :<br>
<br>

<br>
When MFDemuxer is disabled under Opera flags, the same media files will play normally.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Running Opera unsandboxied</span><br>
When MFDemuxer is enabled, the media files will play normally.<br>
<br>
<br>
Starting from Opera 49 Developer, the flag to disable MFDemuxer has been removed and MFDemuxer is enabled by default.<br>

Hi Jim,<br>
<br>
I believe this "Opera browser cannot load media" issue is the same as the ones that were started and raised to Sandboxie developers' attention since Opera 45.<br>
<br>
I had experienced this issue since Opera 45 after Opera developers decided to enable MFDemuxer by default when users complained they could not play some video medias.<br>
I was able to workaround the issue by going to Opera://flags to <strong>disable</strong> MFDemuxer until the recent Opera 49 Developer release when their developers decided to enable MFdemuxer by default and also remove MFDemuxer option in Opera flags  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> <br>
<br>
This is what the Opera developer reply to this issue :<br>
"MFDemuxer was already enabled by default and we want it to fully replace IPCDemuxer . Do you have any specific example why you would want to turn it off and keeo using IPCDemuxer?<br>
<br>
Eventually Mac demuxer will follow this. Currently still in stabilisation phase fixing bugs which appear but eventually we will remove the flag after it has been enabled." (<a href="http://disq.us/p/1lu1rgf" class="postlink">http://disq.us/p/1lu1rgf</a>)<br>
<br>
Can Sandboxie developers now look into this issue with more urgency ?  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>

				<div class="content">I had this very issue in Opera 45, reported it in 46 and had it in 47, too. I can confirm that the fix you suggested actually worked for me (currently running Opera 47) and I have not had any problems playing any sort of media afterwards. <br>
So I guess you really did find the solution there. Thank you so much for that, nanana1! You are awesome! It really improved my sandboxie experience.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
I just hope the developers can fix this issue before they release Opera 49 and we can no longer use your work-around.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation"></div>

				<div class="content">Dear developers!<br>
Are not you ashamed to ignore such a serious problem for so long?<br>
Opera browser (and you will not deny that this is one of the most popular browsers?) does not play streaming audio on sites for a long time.<br>
One of the most valuable features of Sandboxie is the ability to launch your favorite browser in the sandbox.<br>
Buying your program, I thought I could do it.<br>
Please, do the work and fix the problem!<br>
Thank you!</div>
