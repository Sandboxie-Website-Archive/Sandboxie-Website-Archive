				<div class="content">Sandboxie has always been my favourite app for for many reasons.<br>
It's functionality, it's style and architecture and many other aspects.<br>
I think that this is all down to one of the best developers we are ever likely to see.<br>
Tzuk's generous nature and attention to detail within the program and the interaction between himself and his members/users is the thing that has made this software what it is.<br>
A lively forum, with a listening proactive developer and enthusiastic members has been essential in the development of Sandboxie.<br>
I think I've downloaded nearly every version that there ever was, seeing it evolve and meet the demands of ever changing circumstances.<br>
I hope Tzuk that you now can enjoy the financial benefits that you so richly deserve and that you can enjoy life with maybe a little less pressure. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>
<br>
Best wishes to you tzuk. One of a kind.<br>
