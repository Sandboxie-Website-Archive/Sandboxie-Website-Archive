				<div class="content">Just updated both Firefox (laptop) and Cyberfox to v45.0 and started receiving the following error in both:<br>
<br>
The exception Breakpoint<br>
A Breakpoint has been reached<br>
(0x8000003) occurred  in the application 0xf1103273.<br>
<br>
Plug-in related? Flash related?<br>
<br>
edit: End User fault probably. I had web browsers configured in EMET also I deleted the config in EMET and problems went away. Possible Software Compatibility issue? Also I first tried switching to Flash Beta 21 but that didn't work.<br>
<br>
edit2: So much for what I edited earlier. Plug-in container and Breakpoint error are back. The breakpoint error is the same just the hex value for the application changes pretty much each time.<br>
<br>
Win7 x64 || Cyberfox ||MS Security Essentials || Malewarebytes (active protection) || EMET 5.5 || (laptop the same except: Win7 x86 and Firefox)</div>

				<div class="content">Sometimes just disabling an AV program isn't good enough and it causes unexpected issues. Sometimes it takes a removal to see exactly what it could be Kaspersky is one example as well as Norton. <br>

EMET hasn't been tested.</div>

				<div class="content">Been a while so I figured I'd drop an update about my lingering programs issue. I rewrote my rules (well a lot of copy and pastes/alterations) removing the multiple templates entirely and instead using one large template for every single box with specific (!) exclusions and a few &lt;ProcessGroups&gt; pooled from multiple boxes in the GlobalSettings and I am no longer having any lingering sbie programs! I still find it odd that using multiple templates this way would cause anything to linger but at least it's been worked around and now my ini is a few KBs smaller as an added bonus!</div>
