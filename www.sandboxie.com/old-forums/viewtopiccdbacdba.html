Hope you can solve this, its annoying.<br>
Thanks.</div></blockquote>

This is a rare issue. That has been almost completely addressed in the current RC (and through out many beta's previous.). <br>
<br>
What Windows version?</div></blockquote>
Windows 10 64-bit (version 1511). Definitely not completely addressed.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
<br>
How are you starting the program that triggers this error? Forced or not?</div></blockquote>
Double-clicking the Sandboxed Web Browser icon from the desktop like I normally do.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
Timing / race issue with programs loading...possibly.</div></blockquote>
Well this happens way after startup and sometimes is the only program I am starting so I doubt it. And never used to happen in pre-5 versions.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
Did you try use version 5.07.7 previously?</div></blockquote>
I think I went from 5.07.4 which also had the error to 5.08 so no.    5.07.2 also had the problem but I think 5.05 was better if I recall. 
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
Memory allocation (888, 999) error may be present in the error usually. (something we're looking into, but you didn't mention that error having 888,999.
</div></blockquote>
Not seen it AFAIK.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
<strong>Usually, restarting the program again (or making sure the program actually exited from SBIE) will resolve it. </strong>
</div></blockquote>

Yes usually it works on the second or 3rd attempt.</div>

We don't test uTorrent or any other torrent apps with SBIE, so it's unknown if it's a bug or uTorrent will simply not work in a sandbox.<br>
<br>
How is uTorrent installed? On your host computer? Or directly in the sandbox?<br>
<br>
Windows 10 and SBIE require version 5 or better, but rolling back, you risk SBIE not working at all because of Windows updates, Windows Security Changes, other apps, etc.<br>
<br>
Are you running antivirus / antimalware as well? If so, what?</div>

				<div class="content">Ok, I got curious....<br>
<br>
I just tested uTorrent v3.0 (build 25683, 32 bit) <br>
on SBIE v5.09.1<br>
Windows 10 FR 14267<br>
Google Chrome (set as default browser in Win 10)<br>
Visited KAT.CR and proceeded to download torrents without issue.<br>
Norton AV (as branded by Xfinity/Comcast)<br>
<br>
uTorrent is installed on my computer. uTorrent is then run "as sandboxed."<br>
Chrome is run in the sandbox, went to torrent site KAT.CR and downloaded a torrent. <br>
Torrent downloaded to my set download location in utorrent (in this case, another drive)<br>
Clicked on the torrent, and uTorrent began to download it...all within the Sandbox.<br>
Torrent completed without issue, all done within the sandbox. (torrent was large, so you may run into the file size message in SBIE..)<br>
<br>
So, the questions are.<br>
Antivirus or antimalware?<br>
How is uTorrent installed? Inside a sb directly?<br>
Your default Windows browser?</div>

				<div class="content">Hi, many thanks for the prompt reply and information.<br>
<br>
I have run utorrent from the host pc and from installed inside sandboxie - both with and without running as administrator and nothing makes any difference. <br>

utorrent is 3.4.5 build 41821 and sandboxie is 5.09.1<br>
My default browser is Firefox<br>
Antivirus is Avast Free<br>
Firewall is Windows Firewall<br>
No anti malware running (I use Malwarebytes about every week)<br>

Is there any issues with this set up?<br>

Nothing on the surface seems to be a conflict. Did Avast install any FF add-ons?</div>

On the machine, outside of sandboxie it works as nomal, when launched via run any program and navigating to my desktop launch shortcut I get the issues. Also launching from within sandboxie from direct link to sandboxed drive/folder it has the same issues. Driving me a little crazy.<br>
