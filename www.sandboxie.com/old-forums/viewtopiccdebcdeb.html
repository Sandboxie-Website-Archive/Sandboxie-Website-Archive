				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Fri Sep 02, 2011 6:10 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Guest10</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I updated to the newest release of SDelete (1.6), which I use for one sandbox.<br>
The program does not delete the sandbox folder, and leaves behind the:<br>
__Delete_Boxname_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
folder.<br>
The folder is not locked in any way, and can be deleted with Windows Explorer.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's what's happening for me.<br>
I'm looking for the previous version on my DVD-R's, since most sites link to SysInternals for the program.<br>

Is the an automated way to runSDelete (V 1.6) twice as wraithdu suggests??<br>

				<div class="content">Just stay away from v1.6<br>
There are several bug reports at the SysInternals forum that may result in another update to the program:<br>
<a href="http://forum.sysinternals.com/miscellaneous-utilities_forum11.html?SID=9175209e396234711e8za489zdb1b5286805556" class="postlink">http://forum.sysinternals.com/miscellan ... 5286805556</a><br>
<br>
And, Sandboxie cannot make use of any workaround, such as running the delete command twice.<br>
The first time Control runs SDelete, the sandbox is renamed, prior to deleting the files and folders.<br>
Trying to run Delete Contents a second time will fail, with the message that the sandbox is empty, because it was renamed and now the sandbox with that name no longer exists.<br>
<br>
I did wonder why these "__Delete_(Sandbox)_xxxxxx" folders were accumulating.<br>
Typically, they still contained a file or sub-folder that hadn't been deleted, so they were not completely empty.<br>
<br>
I had 3 or 4 of them, since another one would be added each time I deleted contents.<br>
I could easily delete them using Windows Explorer, and yet Control wasn't deleting them.</div>

				<h3>SDelete 1.6 has a bug on recursive deletion</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Thu Oct 06, 2011 10:48 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Guest679</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I have tried SDelete 1.6 and its recursive deletion switch "-s or -r" does not work properly. After running it on a folder with some subfolders there are a bunch of (sub)folders left behind which are not deleted. Only through repeatedly running "sdelete -s" multiple times can we hope that the top-level folder be finally deleted. In other words, the recursive deletion is not reliable at all.<br>
<br>
That said, when used in Sandboxie, stay away from SDelete v1.6 and use v1.51.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I wish I have read this post before upgrading to Sdelete V 1.6; But yes it's a mess after upgrading Sdelete.<br>
As Guest10 says, I also have same problem ' __Delete_Boxname_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ' and I have to delete all contains twice.<br>
<br>
Is there any solution on that?<br>
Is anyone know where to find Sdelete V 1.51......b'cause I search every well known site for getting it, but no chance.<br>
or <strong>tzuk (or any other respected member) </strong> plz will u upload Sdelete V 1.51 for download for us ? (I known it's too harsh, but there is no other choice)<br>
<br>
Thanks !</div>
