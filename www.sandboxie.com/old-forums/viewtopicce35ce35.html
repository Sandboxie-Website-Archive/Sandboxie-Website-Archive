				<h3>Question about Messages</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Wed Oct 25, 2017 12:23 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Good afternoon all,<br>
For my setup I have been using the <strong>SbieCtrl_HideMessage=-1</strong> entry in the config file to hide all the messages. This has been working great; however, the one message that I miss is the immediate recovery prompt after a download.<br>
<br>
Is there any config tweak/setting that would allow me to continue hiding all the messages <em>except</em> the immediate recovery one ? Right now I either close the browser and go through the prompts and/or go through the tray icon and do a recovery from there.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Miadyya,<br>
<br>
I added that entry to my configuration and it did not affect the Immediate Recovery popup.<br>
<br>
Please have a look at the immediate recovery settings and ensure it is properly set up:<br>

<a href="../QuickRecovery.html" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/QuickRecovery</a><br>
<br>
If you are still experiencing issues,  please post your configuration file so I can have a look at it.<br>
Configure --&gt; Edit configuration<br>
Paste the contents here, highlight them and click the "&lt;/&gt;" button to format it<br>
<br>

				<div class="content">Thank you for the quick test and reply. I verified that my settings are correct. If I remove the SbieCtrl_HideMessage=-1 entry and reload the config, I am prompted again to recover as soon as a download is done. Maybe I have the entry in the wrong location, I have it directly under my [UserSettings...] heading :<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>[UserSettings_1EC0035F]

SbieCtrl_HideMessage=-1
</code></pre></div>

I also verified the AutoRecover=y is under my [Browsers] heading. I am currently using Vivaldi, SB 5.21.7 (64-bit) (Registered) on Windows FU (latest build and patches).<br>
<br>
I'll send you my full file via PM since it contains names, paths, etc.</div>

<br>
You are correct, I missed the " - " before the 1. I updated it and I see the same behavior that you reported. <br>
This is an all or nothing type of setting. You can always manually hide the messages that you don't want, as they show up. <br>
<br>
Looks like Immediate Recovery is handled by  SbieCtrl_HideMessage:<br>

<br>
You can use Hide All Tips instead? (not sure what are you trying to do exactly):<br>

				<div class="content">Thank you for the confirmation. Funny thing, I got the setting from that very same post; however, I didn't read the last part (which answered my question) - DOH !<br>
<br>
I may end up turning it off and then hide the messages as they appear. I originally looked for this setting because I think my Chrome was getting a little message heavy and I didn't think the Hide was working.</div>

<br>
We can try to fix the Chrome issue that is causing those popups (for the most part, they can be corrected). <br>
If you want to give it a go, please create a problem report following these guidelines:<br>
