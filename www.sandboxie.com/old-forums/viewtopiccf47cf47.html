Your antivirus or another scanner, It could be the scanner scanning as the download ends. You might be able to confirm this by disabling the scanners and doing a few downloads. Why it doesnt happen outside the sandbox and only happens while using Sandboxie? Perhaps, an update by the AV, Sandboxie or Windows broke compatibility of the mix of security programs you are using with SBIE. This things can happen.<br>

Microsoft security essential has a solid record working with Sandboxie, so thats not whats causing your problem. Other antiviruses could cause your issue though. They could take longer scanning when you running a program sandboxed than when is not running sandboxed. <br>
<br>
If you like to disable Immediate recovery (prompts by  Sandboxie that offer to recover after downloading a file), you can. Go to Sandbox settings&gt;Recovery&gt;Immediate recovery, uncheck "Enable Immediate Recovery". Hopefully it helps.<br>

				<div class="content">that was it. once i disabled recovery everything went back to normal, but i wonder what changed in sbie that caused this problem. i have been using it for years and never had the problem before the last few months. when it was stalled there was no significant increase in cpu or ram usage.<br>
<br>
tnx for the help.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello yodar444  and Bo,<br>
<br>
I wonder if this is related to the SmartScreen changes... <br>
<a href="../VersionChanges.html#v_5.22" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/VersionChanges#v_5.22</a><br>
Implemented code fixes to address "SBIE2101" issues caused by Windows Defender "App &amp; Browser Control" in Windows 8.1 and 10 [If you are using the "Windows SmartScreen Template from Beta 5.21.7, you will need to remove it after installing Sandboxie 5.22].<br>
<br>
If you can provide the required information, I will test it:<br>
<a href="viewtopic633b633b.html?f=11&amp;t=19746" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=19746</a><br>
<br>
Also, please be sure to test in a new Sandbox with default settings and let us know the outcome. <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>
