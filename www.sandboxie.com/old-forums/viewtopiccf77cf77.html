				<div class="content">I would like to have a simple square Icon just like a top view of a sandbox not the isometric Point of view Icon that Sandboxie uses currently. Then I would like to have an indicator that Shows you how many items are currently sandboxed just like Defensewall has in it's trayicon. The Defensewall tray Icon basically fits pretty good for Sandboxie imo just add a Frame around the Icon and Change the Background Color to make it look like a sandbox / fit the Topic "Sandboxie". Also it would be nice to have the opportunity to Change the Background of the sandboxie main Window / config  Window. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":idea:" title="Idea"></div>

				<div class="content">Again thank you soo much for sandboxie, but especially in win8 the icon looks very dated. Would it be possible to give the option to change it with an own one? <br>

again, much respect for the program</div>

				<div class="content">I like the idea of a new icon - in the interest of making the project less time consuming I would suggest changing the tray icon to a standard 4 point diamond shape with the same yellow color in the middle, and dropping the pepperoni slices.  Still very recognizable as Sandboxie I think, and still representative of a "box".  Maybe a bright colored frame on the diamond.<br>
<br>
For the large icon, I would add an "S" to the middle of the diamond, something like the Superman logo does.<br>
<br>
I hereby waive all intellectual claims to these ideas and assign them to Tzuk.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey, I just started using sandboxie as well and can't stand the icon. I created some mockup replacements for something I would rather see. They aren't perfect to start with but figured I'd ask for some input here on what is missing or perhaps what others would rather see.<br>
<br>
My (second) try at creating them can be found below though I scrapped the first set.<br>

My current thinking is to make the sand a bit more orangish (not yellow)</div>

				<div class="content">Hi! No offense, but I don't like it. I don't want the Sandboxie icon to look "childish". I'm fine with what it looks now - I love it plain and simple when it regards security. Empty when empty, full when full and the red cross when deleting. It's as it should be.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the input Bellzemos, I can understand not wanting a childish icon and now that I think about it I agree with you there. It just happened to be the first thing that came to mind in regards to sandbox.<br>
<br>
It's a great program and I figured Tzuk didn't want to spend hours trying to design a new one and would rather focus on the code so I thought we could try to come up with something that even he might like.<br>
<br>
I believe there has to be a middle ground where the icon can be less 'cheesy' and still be somewhat basic and informative. I'll think on it for a while and see if I can come up with something more suitable than the kids bucket and shovel that isn't red dots... ideas welcome!</div>

				<div class="content">Well I did another quick mockup of one of the other suggestions posted earlier before I came back and realized you bunch sure are hostile over the subject. <br>
<br>
It's a <strong>rough atm</strong> but I think it gets the <span style="text-decoration: underline">idea across</span>. It's basically the same icon just with some extra lighting and shadow effects and an S rather than the dots.<br>

There is a simple middle ground.  It is  Tzuks program and his icon.<br>

<br>
I am posting my opinion to make sure Tzuk knows that some of us like the way the icon works and looks. There is nothing wrong with it, it serves well its purpose and I hope it stays the way it is forever.<br>
