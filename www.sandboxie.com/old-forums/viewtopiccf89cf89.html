				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
I've recently upgraded my OS from Windows 7 to Windows 10 Pro 1709 with latest build.<br>
My security configuration:<br>
Eset Internet Security 11.<br>
AppGuard.<br>
NVTERP.<br>
ReHIPS (Demo can be uninstall at any time) only for testing.<br>
NVT OSArmor (can be uninstall at any time) only for testing.<br>
HMPA<br>
My question: Sandboxie failed to run any web browser i.e its default web browser I.E or Firefox Quantum.<br>
I can't configure it properly. Whenever I try to run the default sandboxed browser I get a popup message "Initialization of the dynamic link library C:\Program Files\Sandboxie\SbieDll.dll failed. The process is terminating abnormally"<br>
Screenshot:<br>
<img src="https://imgur.com/mXPiQXL" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
Secondly, I can't run Firefox Quantum in sandbox.<br>
I've made some exclusion in AppGuard for Sandboxie but I don't think I did it in right way. Below is the screenshoot.<br>
<img src="https://imgur.com/6ty0luT" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
Help needed:<br>
How can I run application/s web browsers in sandbox? I'm a Sandboxie Pro user and having a lifetime license.<br>
Thanks and Regards,<br>
Sadashiva.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Sadashiva,<br>
<br>
Your images do not work, can you please write the exact errors you are receiving? <br>
Does Sandboxie work if you turn off your security settings? <br>
Do browsers work fine outside Sandboxie?<br>
Have you tested a new Sandbox with default settings?<br>
<br>
Regarding the dll error message:<br>

				<div class="content">Hello Barb,<br>
Its very strange that my other post with all the popup message are not posted. I can't find the saved draft if its not approved in my counter too. It took me some time to type all the issues of Sandboxie in my system is facing but its not posted.<br>
<br>
I gave up now and stop using sandboxie , rather use Rehips instead.<br>
Thanks for your support!<br>

--------------MERGED POST (this post came 7 minutes after the above one)-------------<br>
Hello Barb, Greetings!<br>
The Sandboxie default web browser I.E when tried to run out side sandbox I got a popup message "Could not invoke program: 'C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" System Error Code:This program is blocked by group policy. For more information, contact your system administrator. (1260)<br>
<br>
Again when tried to run IE inside the sandbox I got a nagging popup message (never closing ): dllhost.exe-DLL Initialisation Failed. "Initialisation of dynamic link library C:\Program Files\Sandboxie\SebieDll.dllfailed. The process is terminating abnormally."<br>
<br>
Would you please guide me which security software is causing this trouble? Everything was fine in Windows 7 with same security configuration . I used it for more than 4 years without any issue but in Windows 10 it's a never ending issue.<br>
<br>
P.S The screenshots image was not posted properly so I'm posting the Sandboxie executable file in AppGuard's exclusion list . The following Sandboxie executables has been given memory Write/Read access: sandboxierpcss.exe, sbiectrl.exe, sbiesvc.exe, and start.exe in AppGuard's Power App. <br>
Thank you very much for taking time in replying my question.<br>
Sadashiva.</div>
