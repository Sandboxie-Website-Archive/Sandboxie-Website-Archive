				<div class="content">I have added "Adobe Reader XI" to the forced programs. The program itself works fine with Sandboxie. But if you click on a PDF file in the "Windows Explorer", Sandboxie starts with two "AcroRd32.exe" processes and blocks the PDF file from being deleted for about one Minute. After this minute Sandboxie automatically stops and closes the two "AcroRd32.exe" processes. This occurs only on my systems with Windows 7 32-bit (and Windows XP 32-Bit). On systems with Windows 7 64-bit Sandboxie doesn't show this behavior. Any ideas? Thanks!</div>

Adobe is a funny beast.  I would suggest you don't force the reader, but just right click on the pdf file and run it sandboxed, when you need it.  This has never given me a problem on XP.<br>

Fair enough.   So I tested.   I don't use the Reader, because I have Adobe Acrobat Pro XI.   I built a separate Sandbox, and I forced Acrobat.exe.   I also had to force 4 other associated programs that run.  Once set up, I was able to click on the Acrobat Icon and it would open sandboxed.  Also was able to double click a pdf and it opened Sandboxed.  Finally using Windows Explorer I double clicked a PDF and it also was fine.<br>
<br>
So, go back and look at everything that runs when you invoke the reader.  Make sure all those exe's are Sandboxed.  Then see if it works.<br>
<br>
Oh, I am using XP Pro SP3, not fully updated.<br>

Hi Pete, allowing extra programs to run is not his solution. He is probably seeing message SBIE 2314 (SBIE2314 Canceling process program.exe). I saw a couple of those in my Firefox sandbox (W7 32 bits) after upgrading to Firefox 22. In my case, I haven't seen the message again after upgrading SBIE to 4.03.02.<br>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the replies. As I wrote in my first post: "The program itself works fine with Sandboxie." I'm able to double-click and open PDF files without any issues. But if I want to delete a PDF file on my system with Windows 7 32-bit Sandboxie blocks this for about one minute, because it starts the forced "AcroRd32.exe" twice and closes them after the minute. There are no Sandboxie messages.</div>

				<div class="content">It sounds like the Adobe Reader shell extension (32-bit) runs the actual .exe program, instead of it only happening (running) inside the Explorer process, etc. I don't know that anything can be done to fix that when it's forced... Can you disable its shell extension or Explorer previews, etc.?<br>
<br>
Of course if it was like the OLD Adobe Reader I used (before switching to PDF X-Change), and it ran in Explorer, then a malicious PDF could still be a problem, <em>if</em> everything in the document is "run," like opening separately, when only generating a preview...<br>
<br>
64-bit Windows runs 64-bit Explorer by default, right? If so, you'd probably see the same behavior there if you run 32-bit Explorer, assuming the 32-bit shell extension got installed.</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you for your reply. If I remember correctly this behavior occurs the first time with "Adobe Reader 10". Tzuk made an update for better compatibility. The Sandboxie versions 3.x start the two "AcroRd32.exe" processes also, but close them after a few seconds. The new Sandboxie 4.x sadly needs a whole minute. Maybe Tzuk can optimize this? Otherwise I have to find out where to disable the shell extension / preview function in "Adobe Reader XI".</div>

				<div class="content">Tzuk, do you think it is possible to fix this blocking behavior on a Windows 7 32-bit system? Thank you.<br>

Another update: This happens with PDF files on a local HDD/SSD only, with PDF files on network shares the problem doesn't occur.</div>

The program "Adobe Reader XI" itself works fine with Sandboxie. The problem is following:<br>
<br>
- Open the "Windows Explorer" and click on a PDF file on your local HDD.<br>
&gt; Sandboxie starts two processes of "AcroRd32.exe" now. <br>
- Press the "DEL" key or select "Delete" from the right-click menu.<br>
&gt; Sandboxie prevents deleting the file until it closes the two processes.<br>
<br>
This occurs on Windows 7 32-bit only.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm sorry but I don't see the problem.  I see only one acrord32.exe process in the sandbox, just like on 64-bit Windows 7, and the process quits as soon as I close the Reader window.<br>
<br>
You can try to set acrord32.exe as a lingering program, that might help make it quit faster.  To do that, right click on acrord32.exe in Sandboxie Control, then check the box for "stop this program if it lingers in the sandbox after other programs...".</div>

But there is still a big misunderstanding! Again, the program itself works fine. There is no problem viewing PDF files or closing the "Adobe Reader".<br>
<br>
Please read my posts of this thread and please proceed like this:<br>
<br>
- Windows 7 32-bit, Sandboxie's DefaultBox has "AcroRd32.exe" as a forced program.<br>
- Open the Windows 7 file manager "Windows Explorer".<br>
- Click only once (<span style="text-decoration: underline">no</span> double click!) on a PDF file on your local HDD.<br>
&gt; Sandboxie starts <span style="text-decoration: underline">two</span> processes of "AcroRd32.exe" now. <br>
- Press the "DEL" key or select "Delete" from the right-click menu.<br>
&gt; Sandboxie prevents deleting the file until it closes the two processes.<br>
(Sandboxie needs about one minute for closing those two processes.)<br>
<br>
This occurs on Windows 7 32-bit only. On Windows 7 64-bit Sandboxie never starts any "AcroRd32.exe" processes if you click only once (single click) on a PDF file!<br>
<br>
I hope it is clear now.</div>
