				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sun Jan 14, 2018 4:16 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I'm using a license'd version of sandboxie to load 4 instances of the game Diablo II. Last night I began doing so, and it worked smoothly. Today it will not run smoothly no matter what settings I use, restarting pc and so-forth. <br>
<br>
My rig is an i7 w/ a 1060 w/ 8gb and 16gb ram<br>
<br>
It should not be doing this, so i'm certain that there is some error or setting within sandboxie that I am unaware of.<br>
<br>
I would greatly appreciate any help in fixing this issue.<br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>

<br>
Does it work fine outside Sandboxie? <br>
Please try creating new Sandboxes with default settings and see if the issue follows you there.<br>
<br>
Are you video drivers up-to-date? Has anything changed since the last time the programs were working? Any updates on their end? <br>
Any Antivirus software updates? <br>
<br>
Please provide the required info to see if there's anything that stands out:<br>

				<div class="content">The program runs fine outside of sandboxie, and even with 1-2 instances(in 2 different boxes) but when I load a fourth and so on, it crippled my system. <br>
<br>
I’m using windows 10 with the rig specified above. I do not use any antivirus other than windows defender and their firewall. I have few programs on my pc and don’t download random stuff. <br>
<br>
Today I ran four and it seemed to work without FPS dropping. However it seems to come and go. I have delete the content of the sandboxes and remade them etc. I have ran the game in all the different settings(compatibility settings). <br>
<br>
I checked and all of the instances are running on my GPU as they should. I really just don’t understand haha.<br>
<br>
I set the exact same setup, up, for my buddy. He has absolutely no issues and he uses a slower laptop. I bought him a license for sandboxie and set it up identically. I’m really at a loss as to why it’s crippling my PC.<br>
<br>
<br>
------------MERGED POST-------------------<br>
I am running the newest Sandbox version, and I have tried reverting to 5.20 but the issue persisted. Again, no software changes within the game, nor any updates or firewall/virus changes. Windows 10 64 bit</div>

<br>
Considering that the issue started overnight and nothing has changed in Sbie since then,  you need to look at your system for any changes: driver updates, windows updates, anything new. <br>
Also, ensure that the game is not trying to update while running Sandboxed as that can cause issues. <br>
<br>
If you run 1 instance only, do you experience problems ?<br>
<br>
