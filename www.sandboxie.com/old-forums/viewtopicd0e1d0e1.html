<br>
I haven't found anyting on this one (I hope I wasn't blind): I would like to use KeePass (2.x) outside a sandbox and use the drag and drop feature to get usernames and passwords into Firefox running within a sandbox. In my current configuration this doesn't work. Is that a configuration thing or is it possible to implement this feature into Sandboxie?<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot in advance for your comments and support.<br>

				<div class="content">It does not for me either. <br>
<br>
Keepass Auto-Type still works though. <br>
<br>
In my opinion that is way more convenient anyway.<br>
<br>
Don't forget to turn on Two-Channel Auto-Type Obfuscation to help prevent keyloggers if you're gonna use that.</div>

<br>
Read the note at the top of:<br>
Sandbox Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Accessibility<br>
<br>
To me, this setting is a last chance way of making something work, but if it was me I would stick with auto-type.</div>

Asking about KeePass drag n drop.   <br>
KeePass Auto-Type Ctrl+V works okay in browser sandbox.  Drag n drop does not work in browser sandbox.   <br>

Hi All,<br>
I haven't found anything on this one (I hope I wasn't blind): I would like to use KeePass (2.x) outside a sandbox and use the drag and drop feature to get usernames and passwords into Firefox running within a sandbox.

RE: <a href="../index0a26.html?OpenWinClass" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?OpenWinClass</a><br>
<br>
I do not find OpenWinClass= with my [Firefox] Sandboxie.ini <br>
OpenWinClass=ConsoleWindowClass<br>
 OpenWinClass=$:program.exe<br>
 OpenWinClass=#<br>
 OpenWinClass=*<br>
<br>
I tried OpenWinClass=$:KeePass.exe &amp; OpenWinClass=$: Database.kdbx with no joy. <br>
<br>
Curious, how/why Auto-Type Ctrl+V works okay, whereas drag n drop does not work.  <br>
<br>
Comments?  <br>
Thanks<br>
<br>

Maybe this can help setting it up so you can use it Sandboxed:<br>

Yes, drag n drop works fine with KeePass running inside the same sandbox as Firefox.<br>
<br>
Feels a bit funny with KeePass and Database sandbox'd since I'm used to plugins and since Auto-Type Ctrl+V does not need KeePass running inside the same sandbox nor plugins.  <br>
