				<h3>How to configure data folder for FeedDemon?</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Tue Aug 28, 2012 3:17 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I'm new to Sandboxie and just feeling my way around. On installation Sandboxie correctly found FeedDemon and added it to the compatibility list.<br>
<br>
This seems to be a fixed configuration, and programs in the compatibility list don't seem to have entries in the Applications\Folders section of the settings.<br>
<br>
I have FeedDemon set up to cache content locally (to a non-default folder), and when I launch FeedDemon in a sandbox the folder is blocked, as you would expect, but I can't work out how to configure the FeedDemon data folder in Sandboxie. Any help appreciated.</div>

				<div class="content">You are correct that there is no "Folder" setting for FeedDemon.<br>
I'm not sure what you meant by "the folder is blocked".<br>
<br>
From looking at the Sandboxie template for FeedDemon, it appears that:<br>
- there is no pre-set path for a local storage folder<br>
- the .exe name appears to be feeddemon.exe<br>
<br>
So, you need to set your own path to the local storage folder in a Direct Access setting for that sandbox:<br>
Sandbox Settings &gt; Resource Access &gt; File Access &gt; Direct Access<br>
<br>
If it's 'feeddemon.exe' that is saving the data (as it looks like from the template), then:<br>
"Add Program" button: <strong>feeddemon.exe</strong><br>
If it's <strong>not</strong> 'feeddemon.exe' that saves the data, skip right to the next step.<br>
<br>
"Add" button: Navigate to the local storage folder used by FeedDemon.<br>
Select the folder and then OK your way out.</div>

I don't completely agree with you.<br>
Paradoxically I think that an excess of intuitivity could lead to less users supporting this amazing program, because of more users having a lazy attitude.</div>
