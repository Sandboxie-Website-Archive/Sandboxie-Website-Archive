				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
Is there a way to verify that Sandboxie is working correctly while it is running?<br>
<br>
Also, would there be any conflict with Malwarebytes?<br>
<br>
Any help appreciated  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

<br>
Welcome to the forums.<br>
<br>
In order to ensure applications are running inside the Sandbox, you can try this:<br>
Open Sandboxie control, then go to File --&gt; Is Window Sandboxed?.<br>
Drag the Finder icon to your sandboxed application and it will tell you if it is running inside the Sandbox.<br>
<br>
We have an FAQ section, as well as a Known Conflicts section that you will find useful:<br>
<a href="../indexd2c1.html?HelpTopics" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?HelpTopics</a><br>
<br>
Regarding antivirus protection, Malware bytes usually works, but please find more info here:<br>

Thank you very much for your reply.<br>

I dragged the Finder Tool over Firefox web browser and got:<br>
<br>
"The selected window is running as part of program firefox.exe in sandbox Default Box".</div>

<br>
That is what you want to see, that the program is running inside the Sandbox, as desired.<br>
<br>
I strongly recommend that you go over the Getting Started section. You can find it in the link I posted before. It will help you understand how Sandboxie works and what type of things you can configure.<br>
<br>

<br>
The thread I provided for Antivirus protection does include the latest workarounds for Kaspersky, you have to read the last pages to find it (page 12 and on ).  Be sure to read all the comments, as different users provided workarounds.<br>
<br>
If you experience a specific problem with Sandboxie, please post it in the Problem Reports section:<br>
<a href="viewforum8a838a83.html?f=11" class="postlink">viewforum.php?f=11</a><br>
<a href="viewtopic633b633b.html?f=11&amp;t=19746" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=19746</a><br>
<br>
Be sure to search the forums prior to posting an issue, as many may have already been encountered/fixed. <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>

Hi,<br>
<br>
I read through the thread.<br>
<br>
Everything seems to be working fine with Sandboxie, and I am wondering if there is a confliction?
</div></blockquote>
Usually, when there is a conflict you would notice something not working right. When all is well, sandboxed programs pretty much work as if you were not running them sandboxed. Not much difference. Using the browser for this example, sometimes if there is a conflict, when you try to run the browser, nothing runs or you might see a blank page. Another sign of a conflict would be if your browsers takes long to pop up running sandboxed after you click the icon. When you close the browser, if deleting the sandbox takes more than a few seconds that can also be a sign of a conflict.<br>
<br>
But right now, I think you are doing good.<br>
<br>
