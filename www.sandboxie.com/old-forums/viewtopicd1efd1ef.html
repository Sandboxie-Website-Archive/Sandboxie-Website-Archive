				<div class="content">I have installed a Ghostery extension in my chrome browser which is sandboxed.  My question is how can I configure settings to the Ghostery can assess its settings page 'extension://mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij/options.html' which is . <br>
<br>
I am getting the following error message then trying to display Ghostery's setting page:  No webpage was found for the web address: chrome-extension://mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij/options.html</div>

				<div class="content">When you installed Ghostery (Unsandboxed, I hope) did you go though their configuration settings?<br>
The screen has large right and left arrows to page through the settings.<br>
<br>
Anyway, click the Wrench &gt; Tools &gt; Extensions<br>
for "Options" and "Visit Web site"<br>
<br>
As far as I know that's all you have to do, since the Visit Web page at:<br>
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij" class="postlink">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/deta ... cbmpeaniij</a><br>
is just a web page that will recognize that Ghostery is installed.<br>
<br>
And their Options page has no address as far as I can see.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks, it worked. I assumed that the problem was caused by sandboxing the Ghostery. But I was wrong. It had nothing to do with sandboxie. I am all set now. thanks</div>

				<div class="content">There's a good possibility that Ghostery will update its settings while you are running Chrome sandboxed.<br>
If so, then the updates will likely be lost when the sandbox contents are deleted.<br>
The times that I've investigated saving extension settings in Chrome typically involve allowing chrome.exe to have Direct Access to the extension's files in Chrome's Local Storage folder:<br>
chrome-extension_mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij_0.localstorage<br>
chrome-extension_mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij_0.localstorage-journal<br>
<br>
I haven't checked Ghostery, though.<br>

				<div class="content">I am having the same issue with IE11, in a sandbox, and a non-sandboxing Ghostery (for IE it is installed onto HDD, rather than added as a TPL etc...)<br>
Out of sandbox, Ghostery loads fine, inside... no dice!</div>
