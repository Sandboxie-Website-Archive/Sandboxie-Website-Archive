Yes, we saw this in Windows 10 with FF. We believe that SBIE is actually presenting the window correctly and forcing FF to conform to Win10 colors.</div>

About Win 10 can not say anything ...<br>
But in Win XP x86 and Win 7 x64 SBIE 5.04 work normally.</div>

Windows 10 may not have  come out of the blue, but it has been and still is having major changes.   In many ways Windows 10 is also a release candidate.  Also remember 1st and foremost SBIE is a security program to protect your browsers.</div>

What I'd  be interested in hearing from the developers/company is: What is the plan to move forward with Sandboxie on Windows 10 and in what timeline?<br>
<br>
Although I am running ok with Sandboxie 5.04 on Windows 10 (fully patched as of today) I am still finding Sandboxie "flakey" (crashes, weird error messages, etc).</div>

				<div class="content">I'm curious, does AllowSpoolerPrintToFile=n override the changes recently made allowing the spooler to write to the temp directory? Also does that change only allow writing to the temp directory 'inside the sandbox' or is to the real system temp dir? It sounds like the 'real' system...but figured I better double check.</div>

Maybe you should be more specific about what doesn't work in steam ... because I've installed it and several games within a sandbox under default settings and have had zero problems to date with it.</div>

If you read up in the thread you will see I have explained what the issue is with steam weeks ago. Others have confirmed the same problems. <br>
<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Peter2150 wrote:</cite>Windows 10 may not have come out of the blue, but it has been and still is having major changes. In many ways Windows 10 is also a release candidate. Also remember 1st and foremost SBIE is a security program to protect your browsers.</div></blockquote>

I do realize this is a security program and hence I'm asking why this could be considered a RC when it is clearly in a state that does not justify it. There are still too many things broken or unfinished. Saying this is a program for your browser is simply false. Check the homepage it says "Safely try new software". It doesn't say safely try new browsers. <br>
<br>
Win10 is also not a RC as you claim. Look at other security products, they achieved full compatibility weeks and months ago. <br>
<br>
I have used SBIE on Win7, Win8, Win8.1 without any major issues, in fact it has been running fine for 99% of the time. However this Win10 release just seems botched from the start.</div>

It's offtopic right now, but you can install software as layers. Enable, disable, remove them when not needed. Symantec Workspace Virtualization <strong>Admin</strong> can do that for example</div>

Hi ozb3n<br>
<br>
I understand your reason, but, and it's a big but.  If any software published is forcing unneed, or unwanted stuff on you, you would be very wise to not install that software period.  Ignoring that rule you will eventually get bitten badly.</div>
