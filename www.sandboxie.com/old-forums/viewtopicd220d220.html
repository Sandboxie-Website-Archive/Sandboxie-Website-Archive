				<div class="content">I have a problem with Sandboxie v4.02 (version 3.76 works OK).<br>
So far I noticed it only with one program:  Website-Watcher v12.0.<br>
<br>
The error: "The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000142)."<br>
<br>
OS: Windows 7 (64 bit).<br>
<br>
Is there some configuration/tweek that I can change to fix this?</div>

				<div class="content">I tested with version 4.02 (and version 4.03.02), the program seems to correctly install and start up in the sandbox.<br>
<br>
Maybe you have SRP, AppLocker or some other type of anti-executable, that is playing a part here.  This is just a guess.</div>

<br>
It does work just fine with Sandboxie 3.76.<br>

Is there some sort of debug/trace mechanism to troubleshoot this problem?<br>

What is error  (0xc0000142)?</div>

				<div class="content">Same problem here, with Tor Browser version 2.3.25-10 as well as the precedent one.<br>
<br>
When i switch back to Sandboxie version 3.76 everything works as supposed to.<br>
<br>
My current config : Windows7 x64 with Emet 4.0.4913<br>
Previous config: Windows7 x 64 with Emet 3.5 Tech Preview<br>
<br>
What i tried so far: <br>
Disabled all boxes for Sandboxie as well as Tor Browser within Emet 4 Application Configuration Pane.<br>
Removed (deleted) those 2 applications from the Emet's applications list.<br>
<br>
Result: Still can't open Tor in Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
I do not use any other SRP on my system.<br>
<br>
Any help will be appreciated. <br>
Thanks for your input.</div>

				<div class="content">SRP and AppLocker are Windows feature that limit which programs can run.<br>
I am not sure that using them in together with Sandboxie causes these errors but I thought I would ask.<br>
<br>
This is probably caused by some conflict with some third party software, but I can't reproduce the problem<br>
or look into fixing it before we figure out which other software is needed to trigger the error.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
Thanks for the reply.<br>
I shall uninstall EMET 4 and any other "suspicious" app, completely and see how the system will react.<br>
Will keep you posted about my findings and hopefully the culprit would be apparent.</div>

				<div class="content">I have an old computer, which runs Windows XP (32bit), with almost all  third party software identical to my Windows 7 64bit.<br>
<br>
I have no problems with the XP machine and Sandboxie 4.02.  It runs WW like a charm.<br>
<br>
For me, this eliminates the "third party" theory.</div>

				<div class="content">Please find here below what i have tried out: <br>
<br>
-Complete Uninstall of Emet Ver 4<br>
-Complete Uninstall of .NetFramework v 4.5 (required for installation of Emet 4)<br>
-Complete Uninstall of Comodo Security Suite (latest)<br>
<br>
<br>
I then ran Sandboxie V4.02 &amp; 4.03 alternatively, the issue persists.<br>
Note that the problem is only with Tor Browser witch runs flawlessly in a non-sandboxed  environment.<br>
<br>
Version 3.76 however does not trigger the error message, even with all the above applications installed and running.<br>
<br>
Im willing to gather and provide any data/log files that could help troubleshoot the matter; so please don't hesitate.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for checking Triage, I appreciate that you took the time to do that.<br>
<br>
I did not test Tor Browser actually, only Website-Watcher.  It is possible the problems are not related.  Let me try to run Tor Browser to see what I get.</div>

				<div class="content">I was able to successfully run Tor Browser in a sandbox, in fact I installed it completely into a sandbox before running it.<br>
<br>
So it is just like the Website-Watcher case after all.<br>
<br>
Most likely something in your computer is conflicting with Sandboxie and triggering this error, but we still don't know what it is.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
Thanks for the heads up.<br>
Actually i also just made a simulation in Vm-Ware with Sandboxie + Emet 4 + Tor and everything is just fine as you report.<br>
<br>
So, once again, its likely that one of those Funky Registry keys got wiped out or somehow crippled by something in Windows; causing the error.<br>
I will have to revert back to some earlier clean OS image and rebuild up from there.<br>
<br>
Should have tried this my simulation earlier to save some time for all. Next time i will know better (or stop being lazy), heu ?<br>
<br>
Thanks for the input, and all the best with the ongoing dev.</div>

4.04 does not fix the Website-Watcher problem.</div>
