Because he was either lazy and didn't read the thread, or he just wanted to post for posting sake.<br>
<br>
This thread started in 2007 and tzuk made 3 comments early on.  Bottom line then was it wasn't going to change.  So to keep posting suggestions about it is just annoying.  Hence he got jumped.</div>

Actually no I was not lazy or just posting for postings sake. Why would I waste my time creating mock up icons just to make 1 post?! The thread started in 2007, but it suited my 'desired change' hence I did not start a new thread. I see nothing that suggests Tzuk will never change the icon. His 3 posts were:
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
1)<br>
In spite of the icon? Smile<br>
<br>
Some may find it revolting (as implied here) or appetizing (as in other topic), but perhaps others, like me, simply find it pleasantly fitting.<br>
<br>
2)<br>
Hey, don't project your pizza hang up on me. Razz I never meant it as a pizza. It's a sandbox, duh! Smile<br>
<br>
3)<br>
Thanks, I appreciate that. But it has been suggested that such shortcuts should use the icon of the target program, with perhaps some overlay icon where possible. I think that makes sense, I think.
</div></blockquote>

<br>
I'm well aware that Tzuk has the final say and may indeed decide to keep the icon the way it is no matter anyone comes up with but nothing I have read suggests that to be true. Thus this part of my previous post.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
It's a great program and I figured Tzuk didn't want to spend hours trying to design a new one and would rather focus on the code so I thought we could try to come up with something that even he might like. 
</div></blockquote>

I wasn't just stating ideas like many of the earlier posts, I was actually creating examples and hoping for  input such as that Bellzemos gave in regards to my first mock-up.<br>
<br>
I was surprised by the vehemence displayed here and have moved on. It's a nice app and the dev seems nice enough, but I didn't come here to cause grief or to deal with any. Sorry for wasting everyone time but please understand that my intentions were exactly that which I had posted earlier.</div>

You are not the first one to suggest icon change, but you must accept that it is classic. Been that for all the years I have used SBIE.<br>
We stand up for Tzuk when someone comes and tells what he should do.<br>
He is his own man <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

If you thought Tzuk might like a new one, but didn't have time, rather then coming up with something and putting out there and posting, why didn't you PM him and ask him.  If he said send him some ideas great, but if he said no, then drop it.<br>
<br>
That fact that he hasn't responded again, tells me he isn't interested, and you are still trying to push it.</div>

I don't know about you but I don't make it a habit to send forum admins, or in this case the dev, a PM about a subject which already fits inside a pre-existing sub-forum. It also wouldn't have made sense as I was hoping for creative input from some sandboxie lovers as I had (and still have) no great ideas for a replacement. My last reply was not an attempt to 'push' it. As I said then, I have moved on from the idea as there seems to be no interest here. It was simply a response to your implying that I was lazy and post boosting. Apparently it's fine to flame people in order to raise your post count but I'm now done feeding the troll.</div>

				<div class="content">Tzuk is a Godsend to me and many others so just lay off already ,   just be thankful for his continued efforts and devotion to keep his ground breaking program at the forefront of PC security ,   he deserves every bit of praise and then some for helping countless people over the years . <br>
<br>
   I hope karma treats him well because he has had a huge impact on so many people .<br>
<br>
Don't let the idiots get to you either , there's always a bunch of those around.</div>
