				<div class="content">I have only downloaded and tested this for a couple of hours and have to say im IMPRESSED!!<br>
The potential of the this program goes way beyond its initial purpose..<br>
With that in mind I would have like to experiment a little with more than 1 profile and feel<br>
that for at least the 1st 30 days a 2nd profile would be made available<br>
Right now i have theories on the effective usefulness of a 2nd or more profiles but currently cannot test.<br>
Never the less my initial impression still stands.. +1 on all counts.. <br>
I will do more testing and more than likely recommend it as a must! to others<br>
<br>
Update: 04/30/2013 11:50am<br>
After a some consideration...<br>
I HAVE JUST PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT <br>
Deserves all the support it can get<br>
<br>
Thank you <br>
Keep up the good work!</div>
