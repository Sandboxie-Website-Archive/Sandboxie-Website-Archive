				<div class="content">Hi tzuk et al. ,<br>
<br>
This isn't exactly a feature request but more of an idea (very far-fetched one); Introducing a OS light virtualization component in Sandboxie, besides its current function of app virtualiz. I understand that its outside of the intended scope of the program at this time, but both are very mingled and interwined that the idea could have some credibility. This would be different than the forced user setting, where in LV mode drivers would be permitted to install -- kinda like how Returnil works. Its like building a bloatless LV option for those seeking an ultimate security app.<br>
<br>
<br>
I understand this is probably too much work and impractical. Its probably not a right time to mention this due to the myriad tasks at hand. So what do you guys think?</div>

				<div class="content">I think a lot of other products already offer the boot-level whole-system virtualization feature.  At this time I don't see an advantage to Sandboxie by offering this feature.</div>
