				<h3>Problems with volume mouned as folder</h3>

				<div class="content">I have one HDD with two volumes. It's a dual boot system (XP and 10x64).<br>
I have several folders from one volume mounted using junction into corresponding folders of the other and reverse, so I have same folders on both systems with same paths.<br>
For example:<br>
mklink /j "C:\My" "\\?\Volume{xxxxx}\My"<br>
mklink /j "C:\Program FIles\SomeSoftware" "\\?\Volume{xxxxx}\Program FIles\SomeSoftware"<br>
You get the idea?<br>
The thing is I don have root directory \\?\Volume{xxxxx}\ mounted anywhere. It's very important!<br>
<br>
And so all executables in this directories can't be launched in Sandboxie, it says that "%1 is not win32".<br>
BUT! If I add some executable name like "SomeSoftware.exe" to forced list it works.<br>
<br>
I do understand the easiest solution for me is to simple mount somewhere the root directory.<br>
As far as I understand Sanboxie checks list of mountpoints, doesn't find what it wants.<br>
BUT! For some reason it works with forced exe's without any problems, so maybe it can be fixed?<br>
<br>
------<br>
Steps to reproduce (tested in VirtualBox on clean W10x64):<br>
1. HDD with two volumes (C:,D:) Windows on C:, D: empty, install Sandboxie<br>
2. Create folder D:\My put some exe there, like myapp.exe<br>
3. Go to disk management, remove association with D:<br>
4. Open admin command prompt, use "mountvol" to learn guid of ex-D, create junction:<br>
   mklink /j "C:\My" "\\?\Volume{xxxxx}\My"<br>
5. Try SendTo-Sandboxie on C:\My\myapp.exe - see the error.<br>
6. Add "myapp.exe" to forced list, start "myapp.exe" - works.</div>

				<div class="content">Described situation was tested on clean installation of Windows 10 1703 x64, Windows 7 SP1 x64, Windows XP SP3 x86 with latest Sandboxie 5.22.<br>
Steps to reproduce in my first post.<br>
I think the problem will be present on any version of Windows with any version of Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
The source of the problem is that operation system sees files from that folder from example not as "C:\My\app.exe" but as "\Device\HarddiskVolume1\My\app.exe". And Sandboxie doesn't understand "\Device\HarddiskVolume1\". I think it should.</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>3. Go to disk management, remove association with D:</div></blockquote>

This is the step that seems to cause the issue. <br>
Is there any particular reason why you need to remove the letter association of your Drive? Can you try mounting it to a folder? <br>
<br>
I tested on Windows 10 x64 + Sbie 5.22  and I was able to launch the application from the link by either keeping the drive letter, or by mounting it to a folder inside the C: drive. <br>

				<div class="content">Mounting root directory of volume in dual boot environment messes up Recycle Bin and System Restore because users have different SIDs.<br>
<br>
Important thing is that <strong>adding executable name to forced list helps</strong>, so Sandboxie CAN work in this situation and works perfectly. <br>
The problem is it can't launch correctly through Start.exe (shell menu/sendto) when application is <strong>not</strong> on forced list.<br>
So forced list does something that regular launch through Start.exe doesn't.<br>
<br>
There may be other situations when path for some reason can't be associated with mounted volume and same problem will be present.</div>
