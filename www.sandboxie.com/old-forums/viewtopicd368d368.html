<br>
Installed Waterfox for the first time and set up Sandboxie to work with it the same way I do with any other browser I use, which means allowing direct access to the entire profile folder.... but it's not working.  Any extensions or option changes I make while sandboxed are gone when I restart the browser later.  First time this has ever happened.  Thoughts?  Thank you.</div>

				<div class="content">The built-in template gives waterfox.exe Direct Access to the folders and files at:<br>
%AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<br>
<br>
If your profile isn't located underneath that path, and while you still have "Allow Direct Access to entire Waterfox profile folder" selected, go to Sandbox Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Folders.<br>
With Waterfox in the "Select folder for" box, click the "Add" button and navigate to and select the profile folder for Waterfox.<br>
Save your work.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks so much - that worked.  I wasn't aware that Waterfox's template had it looking for profiles at the Firefox profiles location.  Any particular reason it does this?  Waterfox creates profiles in its own AppData location, not in Firefox's.  Did it not do that in the past?  Just curious, and thank you again.</div>
