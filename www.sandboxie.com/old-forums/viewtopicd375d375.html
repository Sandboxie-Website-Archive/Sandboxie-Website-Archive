				<h3>Add option to evaluate sandbox rules in file order</h3>

				<div class="content">After researching Windows security for 11 years, I have relied for the last year on Sandboxie for my primary security.  Really great software!<br>
<br>
There is something I have been wishing for over the last year.  Other security software (HIPS I used to use, firewall I still use) achieves surgical precision and simplicity by evaluating rules in the order they appear in file.  According to tzuk (see <a href="../phpbb/viewtopic7bb2.php?t=9427" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=9427</a>), Sandboxie evaluates all ClosedFilePath rules, then all ReadFilePath rules and then all OpenFilePath rules.  If none of these *FilePath rules apply to a file I/O, then a read is allowed and a write is sandboxed.  Thus, the order of these rules doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
I would like a new Sandboxie.ini setting that tells Sandboxie to evaluate these rules in the order they appear in file.  Without the new setting, Sandboxie would work as today for backwards compatibility.  I propose that this new evaluation mode would speed up execution because 1) only one pass through is needed for the three *FilePath rules compared to three passes today, and 2) I can reduce the number of rules to achieve the same effect.  More importantly, the new setting provides more surgical precision in achieving security.  Here is a good example: <a href="../phpbb/viewtopic4d1b.php?t=11714" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=11714</a><br>
<br>
I further propose adding a new rule/setting, maybe called NormalFilePath, that specifies that file I/O matching the path is allowed to read, but writes are sandboxed.  Today, this behavior applies if file I/O doesn't match any *FilePath rules.  This new setting, which would only when rules are evaluated in file order, could be inserted between *FilePath rules to provide more flexibility in file I/O rules.  I suggest that NormalFilePath behavior would still apply if no *FilePath rules match a given file I/O.</div>

				<div class="content">I might suggest a simpler alternative here:<br>
<br>
Sandboxie - as it works right now - prefers denying rules over allowing ones.<br>
Thus it is impossible to block acces to whole drives while still allowing acces to some handpicked important files.<br>
<br>
Suggestion: Change the priority the other way round - or better: Include a checkbox that let's the user decide wether he wants to priorize the block or the allow rules.<br>
<br>
By the way - that's a feature I really miss. <br>
I just found sandboxie very handy to block the Origin spyware from scanning my private files (Origin - Battlefield 3). But Blocking every single sub folder and file in a specific directory just to allow the one which is necceary to run the game is VERY complicated.<br>
This would be an (i guess) easily programmable solution which offers a BIG extra in usability.<br>
