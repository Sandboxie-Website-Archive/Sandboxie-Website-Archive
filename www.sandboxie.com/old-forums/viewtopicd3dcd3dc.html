				<div class="content">I am currently using Sandboxie 5.2 windows 10    64<br>
<br>
I have tried to update to the latest release but cannot do so . I get a warning message that chrome.exe must be closed. But it it was closed.<br>
<br>
Then I deleted chrome and still get this message when trying to update.<br>
<br>
Also recently have been unable to automatically delete my chrome sandbox. I get a message that the files are in use and cannot be deleted, but I can delete them manually but not by using the "delete contents" option of Sandboxie<br>
<br>
Any suggestions?</div>

				<div class="content">Hello tercinial,<br>
<br>
Do you have any security software installed? (Such as an Antivirus). <br>
If yes, disable your Antivirus and re-try deleting the contents of your Sandbox/ updating Sandboxie.  <br>
<br>
Otherwise, you can try to manually turn off the Sandboxie Service (Open Services as Admin --&gt; Right click on Sandboxie Service --&gt; Stop) and then use the Sandboxie installer to update Sandboxie. <br>
<br>
For more info regarding the unable to delete contents, please have a look at the existing threads:<br>

<br>
Tried your suggestions yet still couldn't update.<br>
<br>
Had to go into safe mode and delete all references to chrome.exe (initiated by User "ANONYMOUS LOGON"  ??)<br>
and that allowed the installation of the latest update.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help.</div>
