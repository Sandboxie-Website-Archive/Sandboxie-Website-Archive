				<div class="content">Hi all, I'm new to the forum, I've been using Sandboxie with success for a long period for my purpose, plus obviosly for security, this software is just great, thank you.<br>
<br>
At the moment I'm having a problem with any game wich uses Battleye anticheat, I'm using a multiseat software to save space, electricity and obviously some "$$$" while sharing my PC with my wife.<br>
I know that gaming is not the targeted type of use of this great software, but now that I made almost every game we own working with this method, in the end I'm just giving up with this Battleye Service, <br>
So I can just try to ask you dear developers,<br>
<br>
Now it's been many weeks, in my little free time, that I've tried in any way I was capable of, since unfortunately I'm not very expert in these kind of things, the only way I made BEService.exe to run in another instance without killing the first one is only trough Sandboxie, but as you may know, since I saw many other posts about this, Sandboxie seems to block BEDaisy.sys driver from loading.<br>
I'm not capable of a GPU Passtrough with a Virtual machine since my 4770k doesn't support VT-D , sigh!.. plus I've tried Hyper-V and VMWare but unfortunately the game is not starting because of the the Virtual GPU that is not recognized, well, I think that it would have been very laggy anyway...<br>
<br>
I'm wondering if in next version could be added some kind of an exception for this particular driver..  hoping obviously that it's gonna work, or some kind of hole to make the service run under the sandbox, because it's not possible to run it manually outside of it and let it communicate with the game.. I saw around the web that is a common issue, currently I'm not the only one having this problem at all, <br>
so I can just ask you Sandboxie team! Please make a couple, and many others, happy again! <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
Thank you in advance</div>

<br>
The current priorities are listed here:<br>

<br>
Regarding Battle net, if they block Sandboxie with their anti-cheat methods there is nothing we can do about it. Also, running multiple versions of a program depends on whether the program allows it or not,  we cannot assist you bypassing software restrictions. <br>
<br>
Here are related battlenet threads:<br>

				<div class="content">Thank you for the answer, <br>
I know there are other priorities, I was asking in case was just a matter of a simple driver exception,<br>
Btw I wasn't talking about Battle,net but Battleye anti-cheat service, wich is being used by games like PUBG, Fortnite, Arma3, and many others.<br>
The team said they allow the use of a Virtual Machine, and after the request I sent them, they replied that for them is not possible, not "not allowed",<br>
as I explained to them we are not cheating, and using 2 legit copies of the game... <br>
This is the sandboxie message given: <br>
<br>
"SBIE2103 Denied attempt to load system driver xxx"<br>
<br>
Anyway i'm not going to insist further.. thank you anyway.. <br>
<br>
Keep up the good work.</div>
