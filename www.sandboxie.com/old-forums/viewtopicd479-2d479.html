				<div class="content">PS:<br>
After I posted the above there was an update for SpyShelter. It resulted in a black screen after reboot. But thanks to my USB stick with Windows Recovery saved on it I was able to get back in my machine again, and then use a System Backup.<br>
<br>
I mailed Spy Shelter about it then. <br>
<br>
Yesterday I wondered if that bug was fixed, and installed the latest version. (I have a lifelong license.) And at first everything went fine after a reboot. But after the third or fourth reboot there it was again: a black screen. I waited to see if maybe it only took longer than normal to have my familiar desktop back again, but after 5 minutes knew it was the same problem as before. I have SSD, so it takes 1 minute to go through the whole reboot cycle from Restart, shutting down, and everything back again.<br>
<br>
So also yesterday I used the Recovery Flash again, but after that this time a System Restore point. Then I un-installed SpyShelter, and am now using HitmanPro Alert 3 once more. <br>
It works fine with Sandboxie, and gives me that feeling of extra protection seeing not only the familiar yellow line as frame around my screen, but also a green one now when I poke the upper edge with my white arrow.</div>
