				<div class="content">Hello all, I've been a registered Sandboxie user for about 6 years, and the other day decided to have a play with multiple sandboxes, instead of just using one.<br>
<br>
I quite like how using separate sandboxes further isolates the programs, but I have one question.<br>
<br>
I'm fairly certain that something in sandbox one can't modify something in sandbox two, but can it read it?  For example I have separate sandboxes for Firefox &amp; Chrome.  So if I am running both browsers in their separate sandboxes, and I enter my Last Pass password in Chrome, could something in the Firefox sandbox, say malware, read what I am typing into the Chrome sandbox, hope this makes sense.<br>
<br>
Any help would be much appreciated.<br>

<br>
Sandboxes isolate programs running inside of them, they do not communicate with each other.<br>
<br>
Take a look at these entries:<br>

Very often I have programs running in multiple sandboxes at the same time. But for extra security, when doing sensitive browsing, I terminate all programs in all sandboxes and open a fresh browsing session in a clean sandbox, after I finish doing banking, email or whatever, I immediately close the browser and delete the sandbox. Then go back to regular browsing. I dont mix sensitive and regular browsing. Doing that as well as not having programs running in multiple sandboxes when doing sensitive browsing are good practices.<br>
<br>
One of the links posted by Barb, it says, "But it is still important to first stop all sandboxed activity in all sandboxes, for maximum protection." <br>

				<div class="content">Thank you for your replies, for easiness I think I'll do what Bo suggests, and just terminate all programs before doing anything sensitive.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for your help  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>
