				<div class="content">Is there a combination of settings that I can use to allow programs with internet access, installed in a sandbox, full file access to all of the C: drive except the system folders?  I want the sandboxed programs to be able to move <span style="text-decoration: underline">large files</span> to non-system folders on the C: drive - but I also want to make sure that any accidentally downloaded malware has no access to the system folders.<br>
<br>
I thought this would be a common configuration, but I can't find anything about it when looking at docs and searching the forums.<br>
<br>
I have tried using sandbox settings for full access to C:\ and then setting the system folders to readonly access - (not sure if that's even a valid config) - but then my Sandboxie desktop shortcuts cannot launch the sandboxed programs... ("not found" messages).<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

<br>
Maybe something like this will help:<br>

Regarding copying files:<br>

<br>
Also, you may want to look at the internet access restrictions:<br>

				<div class="content">I really <span style="text-decoration: underline">would <strong>NOT</strong> recommend doing it</span> but in my test with notepad and trying to save files in various folders these seem to be what you want.<br>
<br>
OpenPipePath=C:\<br>
ReadFilePath=C:\Boot<br>
ReadFilePath=C:\Program Files<br>
ReadFilePath=C:\Windows<br>
<br>
That still doesn't cover other sandbox folders either if the container folders are set up for C:\ as well (like default) so things running in the one with those rules could modify files in those other sandboxes as well.<br>
<br>
Doing it this way will also interfere with some normal operations such as if you then try to install a new program into the sandbox and install it to Program Files, it won't be able to create the files and it would fail.<br>
<br>
On another note, I did not see any issues using 'Run Sandboxed' from desktop shortcuts as you mentioned after opening all of C:\ unless the program existed only inside the sandbox. Yet another reason to not attempt it that way I suppose.<br>
<br>
You'd be much better off poking holes for just a few specific locations (<em>say those user folders you move the files to</em>) instead of opening up the whole drive and then trying to re-protect certain things.</div>
