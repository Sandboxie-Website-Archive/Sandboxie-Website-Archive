				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
There are some program out there that wants write to HKLM and therefor oes not work on limited user accounts.<br>
You you add an obtion that would allow this programs when running in the Sandbox to write so as if thay ware started in an admin account.<br>
The obtion may be called EmulateAdminAccount=y, or simmilar.<br>
<br>
This wouls be quite helpfull I belive.<br>

				<div class="content">I think this kind of use should work.  In older as well as newer versions.  Are you asking for this after you've tried it and it doesn't work?<br>
<br>
If you're thinking about the SYSTEM key, it's a different issue.</div>

				<div class="content">Elsewise you may go from the other side:<br>
<br>
1) log in as Admin rights and then run RegEdit<br>
<br>
2) rightclick on the branch you don't want the system to over/write and let access nobody but you (please note- not Admins group, but the very YOUR nick)<br>
<br>
So, now the system will prompt when trying access 'forbidden' branches.<br>
Hope it may help too. Cheers <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"></div>
