				<div class="content">Were there any big changes done "under the hood" of Sandboxie to make it work with Windows 10? There were when Sandboxie went from v3 to v4 in order for it to be compatible with Windows 8. Or is Windows 10 more similar to Windows 8 than Windows 8 was to Windows 7 - and so there was no need for many changes? I hope I'm making sense and not asking too much. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

There is a bug. If you force MS Edge C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_* the MicrosoftEdgeCP.exe and try to execute it then empty sandbox is created, Edge closes before it loads and Windows Store app opens instead. Everything out of the box. Forcing both MicrosoftEdgeCP.exe and MicrosoftEdge.exe does not change anything</div>

Nope, the Beta is open to everyone... <br>
<br>
Okay..a question.. Were you trying to do an <strong>upgrade</strong> from 4.20? We've seen a very similar problem in Win10 regarding a .sys file that Win10 does not allow to be changed while in use (A change in Win10.) Curt has fixed that issue in v5, and we've not seen it in Win 8,1.<br>
<br>
I'd suggest you uninstall SBIE 4.20 &gt; Reboot and attempt to install 5.01 Beta. <br>
<br>
Please let me know if that succeeds.<br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>

Are you saying the installer just hangs?  If it can't replace files because they are in use, it will retry several times and then popup a dialog box that says files are in use and the install can't continue.</div>

I kept getting the attached messages, with installer hanging at that point ...  I tried disabling all security software but same issue recurred.<br>
<br>
I eventually succeeded by uninstalling SBIE 4.20 AND removing config / .ini file ? (which I hadn't done before - it asks yes or no). With that removed, install worked.</div>
