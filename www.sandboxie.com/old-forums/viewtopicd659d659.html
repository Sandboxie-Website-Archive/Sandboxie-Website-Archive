				<div class="content">I like the new feature that allows changing rights dynamically if a program requires it eg for testing new programs, but would it be possible to have the rights auto-revert once that instance of the sandbox has been closed/deleted?</div>

				<div class="content">The point of this change was to make it easier for people who just start with Sandboxie and fairly quickly see the error messages and not sure what to do about it.  What you're asking is to complicate this change with more pop-up boxes and I'm not sure I like it.<br>
<br>
(I say more pop-ups, because it would be irressponsible to change a setting and not tell you about it.  On the other hand enhancing the initial message box to have the option to "turn it off now but turn it back on later" is also a complication in a message box that already has too much text.)<br>
<br>
But perhaps I can give the option to customize the tray icon menu so you can have stuff like a Drop Rights and Sandbox Settings quick access options, if you want them.  (I know some people would definitely like to see a Sandbox Settings command there!)</div>

				<div class="content">My viewpoint is slightly different. I run with drop-rights enabled by default, and can occasionally get caught out by (mainly) new programs that need full rights; and the new pop-up is a great time saver. I am also using Win 7 64 bit so it is more important, and I don't want to run with higher rights ongoing. As currently implemented, if I forget to go back and manually change the sandbox setting, the rights remain elevated with all that implies for security - the same applied before the new option of course.<br>
<br>
I take your point about it being "irresponsible to change a setting and not tell you about it", but this would not be the case if the start option message said it was a temporary rights elevation. It may also not suit everyone, unless it was optional behaviour, but I see that brings its own issues in relation to ease of use. I also don't know how hard it would be to implement. <br>
<br>
Having more tray icon options would make things easier, so yes please, but it is not as secure as I would like in this instance. <br>
<br>
[It occurs to me that I could fudge things using a batch file on pc startup to copy across a default ini file, but it is not ideal and would need to happen before the Sandboxie control loads]</div>

				<div class="content">By coincidence, I tried a program today which required greater rights, but forgot to change them back until I was checking my settings generally after installing the new beta.
