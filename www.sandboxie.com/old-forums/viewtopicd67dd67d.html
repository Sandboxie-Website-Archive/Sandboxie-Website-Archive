				<h3>Open sandboxed if matches xyz file extension</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sat Feb 05, 2011 11:11 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>_is_m00nbl00d</strong></div>
				<div class="content">My suggestion comes in the line of what is suggested <a href="../phpbb/viewtopica1ee.php?t=9803" class="postlink">here</a>.<br>
<br>
Currently, I download files to an unsandboxed folder, where nothing gets execution rights. In this scenario I got no reasons to have this folder sandboxed.<br>
But, I do have different sandboxes for different applications, such as for Adobe Reader. So, if I open a PDF file saved in this folder, it will be opened in the Adobe Reader sandbox.<br>
<br>
I do not force Office processes to run sandboxed, though. I run them sandboxed, manually.<br>
<br>
What I'd like for Sandboxie to offer is a feature to allow to add certain file extensions to be forced to run in a specified sandbox. For example, I want to force *.doc files to automatically run sandboxed when I double-click them.<br>
<br>
What do you guys think, and obviously Tzuk lol ? Worthy to have under consideration for a future release?<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks</div>

Document files [which is anything that is not a .exe or .com] are not programs, and cannot be directly intercepted by Sandboxie.  You should force the corresponding program to the sandbox you want.  In this case, WINWORD.EXE handles .doc files.<br>
<br>
As for clicking documents/programs in a sandbox folder but actually opening them in another sandbox, I don't think I will offer this feature directly.  But there have been requests to be able to specify a list of programs to be excluded from running in a sandbox.  So you when that feature is available you may be able to specify WINWORD.EXE as excluded in one sandbox, and as a forced program in another sandbox.</div>

				<div class="content">I know a document file is not a program, but I was wondering if Sandboxie could ever work that way, by intercepting the file type and then open the respective process, that actually handles the file, in a specified sandbox.<br>
<br>
But, what you mentioned sure is a great feature. Thanks.</div>

<strong>First</strong> - You misunderstood me. I never talked about file names, but rather file types, or simply putting it: extensions (*.exe, *.doc, *.txt, etc).<br>
<br>
<strong>Second</strong> - Correct; which is why I suggested what I suggested (Tzuk mentioning something different is in the making, allowing the same; just a different, and better approach. I just didn't think of it, I guess I just let my imagination flow ;D )<br>
<br>
<strong>Third</strong> - Obviously, when a file type is opened, it is opened by an application/process. Considering I haven't thought of the easy way - what Tzuk mentioned - I let my imagination bring something else.<br>
<br>
But, the file is opened by the predefined application. (Unless the user opens the file with some other application.) Considering that, I had in mind Sandboxie could be changed to allow the user to have a sandbox set to open only certain file types stored in a folder, with this folder being forced into the sandbox, but only files matching certain extensions (*.doc, etc) would be opened in this sandbox, while every other wouldn't, despite the whole folder being forced to run sandboxed.<br>
<br>
As I explained in my first post, I have folder where I download files to. Nothing in the folder has execution rights. I have other sandboxes where I forced my PDF reader to run in it. When I open a PDF file stored in the downloads folder, it will be forced to open in PDF reader's own sandbox; but, if I force the folder to run sandboxed, then if I open the PDF file, it will be open in this forced folder respective sandbox and not PDF. There's no way to exclude this, which is why I suggested what I suggested. I didn't remember of suggesting the option to exclude processes from sandboxes. lol</div>

				<div class="content">hi there,<br>
<br>
just associate the extension with sandboxie's start.exe - it will run the sandbox and the windows "inside" the sandbox will decide wich porogram to start.<br>
<br>
Im used this for .pdf and .pps files and it worked fine<br>
<br>
blabla.doc =&gt; rightclick =&gt; open with =&gt; c:\...\sandboxie\start.exe  or whereever it is</div>

				<div class="content">I tried following the advice here alas couldn't work out what blah.doc and start.exe meant. tried modifying the key created by defaultprograms.exe so .pdf had an 'AcrobatSB' application registered... didn't work. <br>
<br>
Tried opening with start.exe... didn't work.<br>
<br>
In the end the solution was painfully obvious. Open with acrobat. End of. <br>
