Sanddiff works when Sandboxie is not active.<br>
<br>
SandDiff compares 2 moments of a given sandbox. Let´s call them "before and "after".<br>
<br>
In the "before" moment the sandbox folder can be empty or contain information.<br>
<br>
In the "after" moment the sandbox folder must contain information if not it´s pointless.<br>
<br>
Between the "before" and the "after" you must run sandboxed whatever you want. <br>
<br>
When you are done you terminate all processes and you are ready for comparision.<br>
<br>
Sanddiff compares the file, registry and port differences between the "before" and the "after" states of the sandbox.<br>
<br>
Relationship to the reghive and files in sandbox? None. It´s just another source of information to compare.<br>
<br>
I think it´s pretty simple to understand. Let me know if something is not clear.<br>
<br>
The next version of SandDiff will contain a new feature. It will check for malware activity and present results to the user based in the differences.</div>

Netstat is used to obtain the state of the ports.<br>
<br>
Netstat automatically retrieves port information when you press "before".<br>
<br>
Optionally you can press "Meanwhile" button and obtain port information before you press "after".<br>
<br>
You decide when you press "Meanwhile" or even if you want to press it.<br>
<br>
<strong>The user must press "after" when he has finished sandboxed processes</strong>. SandDiff doesn´t determine if a sandbox is still active.</div>

and that is the point i dont understand.<br>
if sanddiff does not care about activity what to determine at open ports and listening apps?<br>
<br>
#hmm - just startet sanddif 1.04 - netstat is needed for the "meanwhile" option and open apps?</div>

Who did say SandDiff doesn´t care about port activity?<br>
<br>
Yes, netstat is needed for the "meanwhile".</div>

I have a computer with Windows XP and Windows 7 installed and when I´m running Windows XP I can see NETSTAT.EXE in \Windows\System32 and does not look like a hard link. The file is 32kb long.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"></div>

				<div class="content">The hardlink is only in Win7.  Maybe Vista, but I don't have it to test anymore.  And the hardlink will seem exactly the same as the real file - properties, size, appearance, etc. - except the Compatibility settings will be greyed out.</div>

<br>
thanks for this great app.<br>
<br>
It would be very nice if it could save registry differences automatically in Windows Registry Editor Version 5 format.<br>

Thanks.<br>
