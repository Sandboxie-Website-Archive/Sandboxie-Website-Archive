I also experience random crashes after downloading files (as I reported before). The problem is that the crash randomly occurs. After I close FF when it crashed and download the same file again FF will download the file without a problem.<br>
In my case FF crashes after downloading a few files (it ranges from 4 to 10 file downloads). Tried to find if an extension in FF was the reason for the crash.<br>
<br>
Tested with Cyberfox 44.0 x86 <br>
- Cyberfox portable clean install<br>
- No addons or extensions installed<br>
- I let Cyberfox "Always ask me where to save files"<br>
- I disabled shockwave flash 20.0.0.286 protection mode<br>
- I disabled shockwave flash  20.0.0.286 plugin (never active)<br>
- I disabled JavaScript in Cyberfox settings (not by an extension)<br>
<br>
After downloading several files Cyberfox did crash again. So in my situation the crash in cyberfox has nothing to do with any addon/extension installed<br>
<br>
system info:<br>
-Windows 8.1<br>
-I do not have any anti virus software installed<br>
-Blue Ridge appguard 4.2.8.1 installed<br>
-Sandboxie 5.07.7 64bit installed</div>

Yep, this glitch is random with a cherry on top.  <br>
Thanks for feedback.   Since, Invincea cannot see/reproduce.....it's just peer to peer.  <br>
I've done some iterations too with observe that Not Responding randomly occurs sandbox'd. <br>
Not sandbox'd downloads cannot reproduce Not Responding.  <br>
W8.1x64<br>
FF44.0.1x64 <br>
v5.07.7<br>
Interesting that Not Responding occurs sans AV and sans extensions/plugins. <br>
I've done new Profile and new default Sandbox.<br>
I've tested downloads from IE11 sandbox'd.  No Not Responding from IE11 yet.... <br>
I was gonna' remove security to test....but, I don't want to run Invincea favored Windows Defender. I run with Windows Update Off and I don't want to mess with Windows Firewall Advanced Rules.   <br>
Thanks</div>

Do you mean FF 64 or 32 bit in relation to sandboxie 64 or 32bit? In my case Cyberfox 32 and 64 bit crash in sandboxie 64bit.<br>
Is it possible to install sandboxie 32bit on windows 8.1 64bit without resorting to any windows compatibility setting?<br>
<br>
Maybe the crash is related to Windows 8.1 64bit? Or are there sandboxie users that experience the crash on other version of windows?</div>

Well, Bertus reports Cyberfox44 x86 and I'm FF44 x64.<br>
You tell me.<br>
When I can break from habit.  I'll download in IE11 sandbox....as work-around.  <br>

<br>
As I said before, I am just throwing out ideas for thos more knowlegable than me to consider (or not). <br>
<br>
My situation is this... I discovered after seeing the dl crash problem for a long time that I had 32 and 64 bit FF installed... I think it was from doing a manual update accidentally using the standard windows installer instead of the 64 bit which I had already installed.  I started to wonder if there might be a connection.<br>
<br>
Another thing I noticed was after reapplying a Paragon image the problem seemed to clear up for while. Seeing as how the page file isnt saved in those images it would be rebuilding at that point... could there be a clue there?</div>

Either.<br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Is it possible to install sandboxie 32bit on windows 8.1 64bit without resorting to any windows compatibility setting?</div></blockquote>

You should install the recommend version for your OS. 64 bit for 64 bit, etc.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Maybe the crash is related to Windows 8.1 64bit? Or are there sandboxie users that experience the crash on other version of windows?"
</div></blockquote>
What you see here is what is reported. We address issues that have similarities or are affecting a serious amount of users.. We then look for reproducible instances. Usually, it'a one of 4 things. Not deleting the contents of the SB, An extension/Addon, Antivirus or anti-malware or something unrelated to any of those 3.<br>

Remove all instances of FF and start again. Make sure you delete the contents of your sandbox too. Or create separate SB for 64b and 32b.

Sure. We've seen issues related to that. Not directly related to SBIE, but just random "issues" that users had. (I've personally seen odd behavior in Windows and Mac OS with saved drive images and cloned drives..)</div>
