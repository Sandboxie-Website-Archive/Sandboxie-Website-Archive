				<div class="content">Hello budfox9, I looked into the problem with DropMyRights.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>posbis wrote:</cite>
Could be a conflict between the two programs. Maybe SB blocks some actions of DropMyRights. 
</div></blockquote>

This is exactly what happens.<br>
<br>
Up to version 2.64, Sandboxie was blocking drivers from becoming loaded, by intercepting OS calls, and denying the call.  (That was the NtLoadDriver call, in case anyone cares.)<br>
<br>
Since its the stated goal of version 2.71 to stop intercepting OS calls, this had to be done in a different way.  And the different way is this:<br>
<br>
Sandboxie now discards the "load driver" privilege from sandboxed programs, so it no longer needs to explicitly deny any requests -- the OS will deny them because the privilege is not there anymore.<br>
<br>
This causes DropMyRights to fail, because it doesn't have all the privileges that it needs in order to function.  In a way your rights are already dropped, inside the sandbox.<br>
<br>
Other than just forgetting about DropMyRights, you can try two alternatives:<br>
<br>
o   right now you're trying DropMyRights from a sandboxed program.  Try it the other way.  First DropYourRights, then use Start.exe to go sandboxed.<br>
<br>
o   tell Sandboxie not to apply its privilege protection.  Set BlockDrivers=no in Sandboxie.ini</div>

				<div class="content">I wanted to bring another issue to your attention.<br>
<br>
Some components in a Windows system decide whether you are allowed to carry out some operation, or not, based on whether your account is a member of the built in local Administrators group.<br>
<br>
That is, not if your account, or that Admin group, have any particular privilege enabled, or any particular access allowed or denied through access-control lists.  But merely whether your account is a member of that group, or not.<br>
<br>
I don't think DropMyRights takes you out of that group, because in many cases, the Admin group is the only group an account has to begin with!<br>
<br>
So I think, if you're concerned about security while browsing, running with a non-Admin account is more secure than running as a 'disabled' Admin.</div>

<br>
I run some trading software that doesnt allow me to run as limited user.  I have no doubt that what you say is true about XP accounts, but I do know that when I have accidentally run IE with dropmyrights for a activeX type install, the install will fail.  <br>
<br>
For me the prefect, low footprint browser security is dropmyrights+ sandboxie. On a sidenote, I have beta tested some of you competitors, and your program in my opinion is still the best.  <br>
<br>
Happy New Year in Bezerkly..</div>
