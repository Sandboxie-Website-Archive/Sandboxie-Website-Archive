				<div class="content">For the last few days if I try to open some Sandboxed pages in Opera or Firefox browsers, I get error messages.<br>
It doesn't happen with all websites or pages, but, for example, if I try to open the Google search page I get this....<br>
"Google unexpectedly closed the connection".<br>
<br>
Another example is if I try to open my hotmail account I get.....<br>
"Outlook.live.com sent an invalid response"<br>
<br>
The problem only occurs when I try to open in Sandboxie mode, applies to other pages/sites too, but as I said, not all. <br>
Unsandboxed, everything is fine.<br>
<br>
Any advice please?<br>
Thank you.</div>

We do not support Windows Vista, however, here are a few things to try:<br>
<br>
Delete the contents of your Sandbox.<br>
Try a new Sandbox.<br>
Deactivate your AV protection (or add Sandboxie to the exclusion list). <br>
Ensure you are using the latest stable versions of the browsers.<br>
Deactivate addons.<br>
Try the latest Sandboxie beta: <br>

<br>
If you provide your browser, SBIE, and AV versions, we'll be able to better assist you.<br>
Also, are you running a 64 or 32 bit OS?<br>

<br>
Thank you for your reply.<br>
<br>
I paused my AV and once I did this I was able to access the websites previously unavailable.<br>
My AV is Kaspersky and I know it is known to conflict with Sandboxie. However, up to a week or so ago, I was able to use Sandboxie without the problems I have recently encountered. <br>
However, I will look to add Sandboxie to my AV's exclusion list, as you advise.<br>
Also, i know you say Sandboxie doesn't support Vista, but I have used it with my Vista OS for quite a while now, with, more or less, no apparent problems, so am a little puzzled by your indication there is no support.<br>
<br>
In any event, your help and advice has helped and I am grateful to you.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Flinchman22</div>

I am not sure if this will do the trick, but you may want to give it a go  (this information was shared by another user, I have not tested it myself):<br>
Settings &gt; Additional &gt; Network &gt; Encrypted Connections Scanning &gt; Do Not Scan Encrypted Connections  (this is for Kaspersky).<br>
<br>
Also, here are the executables that you may need to add to your AV's exclusion list:<br>
Start.exe""License.exe""SandboxieBITS.exe""SandboxieCrypto.exe""SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe""SandboxieRpcSs.exe""SandboxieWUAU.exe""SbieCtrl.exe""SbieIni.exe""SbieSvc.exe"<br>
<br>
And here's more information regarding your AV and SBIE:<br>

<br>
As for Vista, we do not officially support it. However, we will try to assist as much as possible. <br>

Just wanted to update you guys that this is no longer the case if you upgrade/update to KIS 2018 as they seem to have fixed it all in that version and therefore you don't need to add an exception and exclusions and all that....  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"></div>
