				<div class="content">I wouldn't say, because I use Sandboxie to sandbox most programs that run in my computers and use NoScript and Adblock plus with the sandboxed Firefox, I ll live without updating Windows. I update my Windows 7, usually weeks after updates are available I install the ones that are considered as important.<br>
<br>
But at the same time I can tell you, I haven't updated my XP since Microsoft stopped releasing security updates for it and all has been well. I still get updates for Office in XP and I install them when available. I usually check for Office updates once every couple of months. This month I checked twice and didnt get no response at all from Microsoft so maybe I wont get them anymore for the XP. <br>

You should use Windows Update or you will be just as safe soon as any Windows XP or Windows 98 user is. <br>
<br>
Windows Update havn't broken Sandboxie enough times for it to be a problem. And when it happens, the devs have fixed it fairly quickly. By not using Windows Update you are becoming an increasingly easier target to be exploited. If a kernel-exploit is used against your machine, even with Sandboxie, it can do serious harm to your system. <br>

<br>
Now the good news is that malware these days are not actively trying to bypass Sandboxie. That could change. Recently an exploit-kit have bypassed EMET.</div>
