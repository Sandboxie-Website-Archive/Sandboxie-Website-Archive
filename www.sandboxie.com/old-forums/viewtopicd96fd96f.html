				<div class="content">Hey guys, long time user here and unable to recover my email accounts atm *soon probably*. I have a few questions and need help with settings. <br>
<br>
Is it possible to get my sandboxie key if I'm unable to recover my email accounts? Lost my number to access them, I have lifetime license that Tzuk sent me years ago. If not no biggie, I'm sure my email will recover within time.<br>
<br>
Now my settings are messed up that's for sure. I don't want anything running outside the box except for steam since I have problems with it boxed. I would like one sandbox for everyday use, emails etc, chrome + ublock extension and a separate one for downloads, installation etc or unsafe sites so don't want anything to run outside of it. Nothing can recovered back to my main windows if I install something sketchy. Atm these are my problems I'm facing<br>
<br>
1. Rundll32.dll loading outside box when opening windows explorer sandboxed and other applications such as chrome.exe. Normal? I don't remember doing that in the past<br>
<br>
2. When I exit chrome, and terminate all processes in the sandbox. chrome.exe is still in my taskmanager process<br>
<br>
3. SbieSvc.exe with the command line of "Sandboxie_ComProxy_S-1-5-21-418xxxxxxxxx-1001_e_1_0:" starts when I open chrome and still lingers after closing chrome and\or terminating all programs. (long numbers replaced with x')<br>
<br>
4. SbieSvc.exe with the command line of "Sandboxie_GuiProxy_00000001,3652"<br>
<br>
5. Malwarebytes 3.0 can't connect to server sandboxed. The templates I found in the forums don't work. <br>
<br>
6. combase issue I had few days ago spamming me from sandboxie, lost the line it gave me. Updated 5.18 worked though so could of been an issue with chrome and sandboxie. <br>
<br>
7. I can't remember the reason that made me come here and its not the problems I have above. I'll come back to this one<br>
<br>
Should I just paste my sandboxie.ini and template.ini?</div>

Any questions regarding your license should be directed to <a href="mailto:support@sandboxie.com">support@sandboxie.com</a>.<br>
Many of your questions have already been answered, please use the search function in the future... <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> .<br>
<br>
Regarding your Steam comment, keep it mind it uses its own <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework" class="postlink">CEF</a>  browser (so maybe some of the Chrome processes that you are seeing are Steam related?):<br>
<br>
A1) Do you have any Antivirus software installed? What are your OS and SBIE versions? <br>
See if these help:  <a href="searchcdc7cdc7.php?keywords=Rundll32.dll" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/sear ... ndll32.dll</a><br>
<br>
A2) Regarding Chrome lingering in the Sandbox--&gt; Which Sbie and Chrome versions are you using? The issue was fixed in an older beta:<br>
"Changes in 5.17.1<br>
1) Fixed Win 10 FR 15002<br>
2) Fixed Chrome 56 lingering child process"<br>
<br>
A3/4)  <a href="viewtopic4fa14fa1.php?f=17&amp;t=23933&amp;p=125994&amp;hilit=Sandboxie_ComProxy#p125994" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... xy#p125994</a><br>
<br>
A5) If you are updating the software, you need to do it outside the Sandbox.  If you are doing something else, please provide more info. <br>
