				<h3>Sandboxie failed to load due to Email Reader [SOLVED]</h3>

				<div class="content">After many years with no trouble, my Sandboxie suddenly stopped loading. The message was that it could not find Email Reader under <strong>launcher.ex</strong>. I repaired the program - no change. I uninstalled and reinstalled it - no change.<br>
<br>
I eventually found :- <a href="viewtopicdcb1dcb1.php?t=12873" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... hp?t=12873</a> and a post by <strong>Guest 10</strong> dated May 01 2012 which gave a fix for another member that  worked.<br>
<br>
I applied the same fix :-<br>
Sandbox Settings &gt; Resource Access &gt; File Access &gt; Direct Access <br>
"Add Program" button: launcher.exe <br>
"Edit/Add" button: %DefaultSpoolDirectory%\* <br>
<br>
<strong>It  worked !</strong>. A million thanks to the brilliance of <strong>Guest 10</strong>.<br>
Can anybody tell me why this problem suddenly happened in the first place and is it always going to happen with every update ?</div>

Craig,<br>

Not to my knowledge, but Opera my browser is updated often. I don`t know what Email Reader it meant. I have Gmail, Yahoo and Outlook.com on the web and OE off-line.</div>

Of the mails you wrote above, the one that is an EMail reader would be....Outlook Express. Not the web mails.<br>

Hello Bo,<br>
Lovely to hear from you again.<br>
<br>
Everything is going fine after I applied Guest 10`s fix. Have you any idea why Sandboxie suddenly hiccuped with my OE after many years of faultless operation ?</div>

No idea, Yabbadoo. But the template for Outlook express is still working. I haven't used OE for 3 years but a little while ago after upgrading the XP to 5.11.4, I clicked on the OE shortcut and it ran forced in its sandbox. No errors or messages. In the OE sandbox all I have is the standard Outlook express template. For testing you can try another sandbox to see if the template works there.<br>
