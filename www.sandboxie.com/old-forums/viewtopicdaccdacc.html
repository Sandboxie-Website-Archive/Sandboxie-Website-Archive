				<div class="content">I have used and tried a lot of apps that are free some are good most are not, a select few are great.  Avast, WinPatrol, Malwarebytes are such apps, they are must haves to fight all types of malware/virus attacks.  Sandboxies is in their class, it works great, I just wish I had started using it years ago.  We all know that cruising the internet is like dragging a magnet through the dirt, the magnet gets covered in ferrous particles, your computer gets infected with all types of malware if you cruise the internet unprotected.  Sandboxie is like putting the magnet in a plastic bag, stuff still gets attached but it is gone just as soon as you rip off the plastic.  Same with Sandboxie, kill the sandbox and the attacking malware is gone.  I would recommend Sandboxie to anyone that wants a simple solution to malware attacks on their PC while browsing the internet.</div>
