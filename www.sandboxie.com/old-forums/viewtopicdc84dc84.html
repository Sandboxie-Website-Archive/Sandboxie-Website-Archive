				<div class="content">The lag time in youtube alone has me going back to an earlier version. It takes 5 to 10 seconds for each video to load. Non-sandboxed it's pretty much instant. Not to mention, the lack of sound issue still persists. (And I'm not interested in work-arounds)  <br>
<br>
I can duplicate this on both my Windows 8.1 PC's.<br>
<br>
Anyway, for now I'll run version 55 or older and Chrome.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Jeffrey, at this time I am watching a lot of videos in YouTube, this past few days I have been watching the entire OJ Simpson case, from day 1. No issue whatsoever. I cant resist from posting this, this is where I left the case last night, watch F Lee Bailey kick this cops butt about foot prints at the crime scene. Pure entertainment.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r19kjTg7Zc0&amp;index=85&amp;list=PLMI3RjXTXUqrhWN3Vp05AcfyeSgMVMq9d" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r19kjTg ... yeSgMVMq9d</a><br>
<br>
Anyway, I go to YouTube all the time, no issue in W10 or W7. Right now I am in Firefox 59 and Sandboxie 5.24. I use Firefox 32 bits version, perhaps you should try it, Sandboxie works better with it. My W10 is 64 bits, when I got it this past July, without any hesitation, I installed the 32 bits version of Firefox for the purpose of better compatibility.<br>
<br>
I also disable Hardware acceleration and Webgl in Firefox Options and about:config. I do this things despite not having issues even without disabling them. And very important, I disable Multiprocess, I have been doing that since it came out. I never have issues with Firefox in the sandbox.<br>
<br>
I see you are using Avira, perhaps the Web guard also. Try disabling the guard to see if it makes a difference. Or, test disabling the entire AV. Antiviruses can cause delays. An update of the AV can break or fix compatibility at any time.<br>

				<div class="content">I tried everything you mentioned, even going to 32bit and nothing worked. Then I realized something. (Wish I thought of this sooner). I bet the problem I'm having is directly related to the no sound issue. So I applied this fix here...<br>
<br>
Open Firefox outside Sandboxie<br>
type about:config and accept the risk<br>
search sandbox<br>
Switch security.sandbox.content.level to 2 (mine was 3, if needed switch it to 1 or 0 ).<br>
Close Firefox<br>
<br>
...and it worked. So I have sound (which was something I was going to tackle later) and no more lag. I suspect everyone who had the no sound issue had the lag as well but they didn't stick around long enough to notice it.</div>

				<div class="content">Good, Jeffrey. I didn't mention Sandbox content level as I thought disabling Multiprocess would include that <br>
<br>
Workarounds like disabling Multiprocess and changing Sandbox content level fix many problems in Firefox related and unrelated to Sandboxie.<br>
