				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I can also confirm that it now works with all tested Programs. But now other programs has problems (BioShock Inf.) <br>
When I move the Mouse, the whole display freeze until I stop mouse movement. Go back to 3.76 solve this behavior.<br>
I will try now an other V4 to see if there is an problem too...<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: The oldest V4 I could get was the 4.04 which has the same issue. Can I get some older Versions somewhere?</div>

Try <a href="../indexd906.html?AllVersions" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?AllVersions</a><br>
<br>
BTW, may I know how can you managed to run L4D2 inside Sandboxie?<br>
For me there is always an error (Steam error, which the error code is 2)<br>
<br>
Installed VC redist 2008-2012, and I can confirm that Steam service is started.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks a lot, not every Version but now I can test some more.<br>

Hmm, since the Steam-Service can run in Sandboxie I had no problems with L4D2 anymore... I just installed it. Steamclient first than the game...</div>

Thanks.<br>
I used the same step as you and I confirmed that the steam service is running properly.<br>
Weird...<br>
<br>
Will submit it to tzuk later</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I'm again. Sorry for the delay, but now I'm sure that all 4.x Version have the Problem. Any Ideas what can I do to to solve this issue.<br>
Every time I move the Mouse the window freeze (0FPS). <br>
<br>
That now the only Reason because I stay on 3.76.<br>
<br>
Best Regards<br>
