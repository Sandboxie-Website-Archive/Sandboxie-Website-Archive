				<div class="content">I was using Sandboxie long time ago in XP and stopped using it when I switched to 7 because at that time, it didn't work on 64bit due to kernel protection. Anyways, what I am looking for is some kind of rollback to a previous state (snapshot) function. I did use the search function and it seems Sandboxie is not what I am looking for. But maybe I'm on the wrong track and have to use a different approach, so let me try to explain:<br>
<br>
I'm looking for a solution that lets me completely get rid of previously installed software. By completely I mean everything the application has done to windows should be reversed by 100%. I remember an old tool that was called CleanSweep that let me did that.<br>
<br>
Question: So if I sandbox an application installer will everything this installer does, even if it executes other PEs and DLLs will be reverted if I delete that sandbox later?<br>
<br>
Full explanation: I used this BigFishGames installer for my daughter to try out games. And first thing this application manager wanted to install was Bing toolbar.<br>
<br>
So am I on the right course with Sandboxie or should I better look for other solutions like a VM?</div>

If you install a program in a sandbox and it installs something like the Bing toolbar, the toolbar will be gone when you delete the sandbox. All changes are gone when you delete the sandbox.<br>
