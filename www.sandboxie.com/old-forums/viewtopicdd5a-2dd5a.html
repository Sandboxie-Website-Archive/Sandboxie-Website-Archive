				<h3>Sandboxie icon</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sat May 19, 2007 2:23 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Unknown_User_793</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
I learned about sandboxie last night after reading the comments posted to a red tape chronicles article concerning drive by script hackers.  I came to the site to learn more about it and download it, but then saw the icon.<br>
<br>
I am wondering if it would be possible to jazz up the icon?  The first thing I thought of when I saw it was a grilled cheese sandwich with mold. Yuck!<br>
<br>
I'd be happy to send you a screenshot of my desktop or system tray to present some of the icons created by other developers, which might spur some ideas.<br>
<br>
In spite of the icon, I did email my network and apprise them of your tool as it will be very helpful in these days.<br>
kind regards,<br>
Sue</div>

				<div class="content">Lol, thats a first, normally ppl say the icon looks like a slice of pepperoni pizza, anyways, i guess the icon <em>could</em> use a touchup (btw anybody remember in the older versions the icon looked like ie in a jailcell?) i guess i could try opening photoshop cs3 extended and try designing an alternative icon, i have a few ideas, but honestly im fine with the icon the way it is.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks so much for your openness.  It didn't keep me from recommending Sandboxie because it's a very much needed technology!<br>
<br>
Some programs that have great icons that I know of include AB Commander and Desktoplet by Winability, Awasu, Surfulater, Startup Faster, Voice Email Pilot (by Color Pilot), the O&amp;O Software tools, Comodo Firewall, Riva FLV Player, Pando, Snagit 8 (Techsmith), DIManagerX by Pix-Art, Data Extractor by Iconico<br>
<br>
I hope this helps!<br>

Some may find it revolting (as implied here) or appetizing (as in other topic), but perhaps others, like me, simply find it pleasantly fitting.</div>

				<div class="content">I think it would be good to have a choice of icon.<br>
<br>
Winamp gives a choice of several systray icons for its Agent.<br>
<br>
Why do we only get pizza?<br>
<br>
Just because tzuk loves pizza?<br>
<br>
Suppose you don't like pizza?<br>

				<div class="content">Please, I am sorry for last post; I was out of line.<br>
<br>
We are all thankful to tzuk for his wonderful program, and if wants to pay homage to pizza I must respect his choice.<br>
<br>
However, if I may suggest:<br>
<br>
Pepperoni is not most healthful of topping for pizza.<br>
<br>
We keep pizza icon, but could we have a choice of topping.<br>
<br>
Broccoli, Olives, Mushrooms are all very healthy choice of topping for pizza.<br>
<br>
What they use for icon creation? Microangelo?<br>
<br>
I will try to create a Broccoli pizza and submit for your review.</div>

Actually although that would be cool, there is no possible way to achive that. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"></div>

				<div class="content">Thanks, I appreciate that.  But it has been suggested that such shortcuts should use the icon of the target program, with perhaps some overlay icon where possible.  I think that makes sense, I think.</div>
