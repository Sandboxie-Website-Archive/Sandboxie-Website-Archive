				<div class="content">I run chrome browser sandboxed to access torrent sites then run utorrent sandboxed but the folder to which the dowload goes to called sandboxie in drive c isn't sandboxed it seems ie chrome has yellow border and utorrent also does but the destination of downloads folder doesn't have the yellow border - my concern is if a download is contaminated and goes to c: sandboxie can the contaminated enter folder/files of the c drive - i expected the destination folder to be sandboxed but it doesn't appear to be - i know i can open the folderby right clicking and choosing to open sandboxed but this doesn't prevent in my understanding downloads possibly contaminated can effuse contamination out from that folder which i wouldn't be able to do if it were yellow bordered sandboxed - please excuse my verbosity but i am trying to fully understand how sandboxie works this mentioned issue - please advise if you understand my question and have consideration thereon</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Todd, I understand your question, I also wondered about this a long time ago <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> When you force your Downloads folder in C drive, the folder its not supposed to show the yellow border. But if you run a file that's inside the folder, then that file runs sandboxed and shows the yellow border. <br>
<br>
There are times were the yellow border would show when you force a folder. For example, if you force your USB drives, as you insert a flash drive, your USB folder opens up showing the yellow border but that is because when you insert the flash drive the folder opens  in a sandboxed version of Windows explorer. If you close this Window and later navigate back to your USB folder, you will not see the yellow border anymore. But files that run out of it, do. HTH.<br>
