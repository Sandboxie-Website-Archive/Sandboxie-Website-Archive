				<div class="content">Thanks for the update. It fixed the msgwait.exe problem.<br>
<br>
I have configured the path:<br>
<strong>copy "C:\Sandbox\Superman\DefaultBox\RegHive" hive_1.bak /v /y &gt; NUL</strong><br>
<br>
Every time I run the sandboxdiff I encounter this error message:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>file open error:[hive_1.reg.txt]</code></pre></div>
What is this?<br>

Windows XP<br>
Yes<br>
Did you hardcode the default path of Windows? In other words does it still work if people installs Windows in other drives (drive letter other than C)?</div>

				<div class="content">Yes it should works. BTW is your Windows folder'path in another drive, other than C?<br>
<br>
1. Can you try this?: to do the bat file e.g. 'name.bat' in your text editor with:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: normal">@echo off<br>
reg.exe load HKU\hive hive_1.bak<br>
reg.exe export HKU\hive hive_1.reg.txt<br>
reg.exe unload HKU\hive<br>
pause</span><br>
<br>
Run it; some warnings? did it create a 'hive_1.reg.txt' file?<br>
<br>
2. Copy 'reg.exe' to where 'SandboxDiff.exe' is. Run 'SandboxDiff.exe'. Same message yet?</div>

				<div class="content">My account is a limited user account I guess it's the cause of the problem.<br>
<br>
1. It cannot run even though the account has "read" and "read and run" rights on reg.exe<br>
The message complains:<br>
Error: The client has no special rights to run it<br>
System couldn't find specific registry key<br>
Error: The client has no special rights to run it<br>
<br>
2. I copied the reg.exe using the admin account.<br>
I added my account into the group. Set "read" and "read and run" rights.<br>
Same error message:<br>
file open error:[hive_1.reg.txt]<br>
<br>
What should I configure to allow a limited user account to run it successfully?</div>

<br>
2. As a workaround, you can use an Administrator account to run the program by performing the following steps: <br>
<br>
Right-click the program shortcut, then select Properties. <br>
From the Shortcut tab, click Advanced. <br>
Select the "Run with different credentials" check box, as this figure shows, then click OK. <br>
Click OK to close the Properties dialog box. <br>
<br>
Now, when you execute the program shortcut, XP will prompt you to enter the user context in which you want to run the program. Select "The following user" and specify a non-limited account.</span></div></blockquote>

				<h3>File Comparison: More than Filename/Presence of File?</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Thu Aug 13, 2009 12:49 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Todd</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Much thanks for this SBie add-on; works great!<br>
<br>
Regarding the file comparison, does SandboxDiff compare any more than the filename--or simply the presence of the file(s)--in the sandbox?  For example, if a file already present in the sandbox was updated (but filename remained the same) during a sandboxed program session, would SandboxDiff detect the difference and highlight it green in the results?  Or would the before and after entries remain un-highlighted?<br>
<br>
The reason I ask is after testing it on a program installation, I thought it would be interesting to test it on a subsequent update to that program (weeks later).  Prior to the update test, I ran a sandboxed session of the program to pre-populate the sandbox with files already installed and used by the program (so those that didn't change after the update wouldn't show up highlighted green in the results [they would if they weren't in the sandbox already]).  I then started SandboxDiff, started the sandboxed program, then updated it in the sandbox.<br>
<br>
SandboxDiff worked just fine.  But what I'm not sure is whether one or more files that were updated (but no change to filename) were recognized by SandboxDiff as having changed.  Does SandboxDiff check any other file attributes?  One way to be sure would be to compare a before and after hash (such as SHA1) of the files, but not sure how that would impact comparison speed (runs pretty zippy on my XP SP3 quad-core CPU).<br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>

No, it doesn't do that. I'll check if it's easy to do something like that.<br>
<br>
I appreciated your feedback and your question/suggestion. Thanks.</div>
