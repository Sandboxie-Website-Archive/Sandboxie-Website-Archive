				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I was just wondering if it was possible to force sandboxed applications to connect entirely through a socks5 proxy or ideally even Tor? (not browsers, just small stand-alone applications and executables)<br>
<br>
Or am i better off just sticking with using VMware and routing the entire VM?<br>
<br>
Sandboxie would be a cleaner solution for myself if this is possible than having to clone clean VM's (or run multiple side by side due to the time this takes) as often as I am due to storage restrictions on my testing system.  I'm not keen on running VM's from external media, even with usb 3.1 (as copying the clean VM bases is slow enough via that as it is), i'd rather they be on local storage.<br>
Sadly I cannot afford to upgrade as i'm putting all the money i can into a decent server which will ultimately run (at least, hopefully) a dozen concurrent VMs via unraid, but that will take a while to finish and if this could be done in sandboxie it would help a lot in the meantime.</div>
