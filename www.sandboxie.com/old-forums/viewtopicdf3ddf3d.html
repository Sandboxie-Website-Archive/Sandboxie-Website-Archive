				<div class="content">Hi y'all!<br>
<br>
May you implement a feature where clicking on downloaded file in google chrome opens WITHOUT sandbox -- ESPECIALLY if i gave file access in preferences? To give file access preferences, please see old post (<a href="viewtopica2c5a2c5.php?f=11&amp;t=21399&amp;p=110765&amp;hilit=kayt#p110765" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... yt#p110765</a>). Like do you know what I mean? I mean, if i give FULL file access in preferences to my desktop folder, download folder and user document folder, then I would like to download to those folders (using google chrome) and open them (using the google chrome interface) instead of going ALL THE WAY to window explorer, opening the folder, and then double-click on the file. This is quite inconvenient! Please consider.<br>
<br>
Best,<br>
<br>
KayT</div>

				<div class="content">You can already do this via Quick recovery. Just remember, you're basically telling SBIE that it's ok to trust it. That file is no longer contained. We won't do this by default, as that creates a security hole.<br>

				<div class="content">RooJ's response in the linked thread explains why this cannot be done. When you click on a file in the Chrome download bar, Sandboxie sees it as sandboxed Chrome starting a child process. There is no way to verify if this is good or bad, so it must be started inside the sandbox.
<blockquote><div><cite>RooJ wrote:</cite>
Regarding "but this is only a download!"; If you can download to a folder without a prompt then so can a malicious application or a compromised browser. Sandboxie can't read your mind and so doesn't know whether you intended to download the file or whether your spyware infected browser decided to do it. The extra seconds it takes to click the recover button could one day save your system from being compromised so be careful what folders you add to direct access etc.</div></blockquote></div>
