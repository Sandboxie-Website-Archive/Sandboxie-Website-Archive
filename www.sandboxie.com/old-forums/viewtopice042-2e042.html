				<div class="content">I hope Curt reads this and explains why my thread here has been closed: <a href="viewtopicc941c941.php?f=11&amp;t=19665" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... 11&amp;t=19665</a>.<br>
<br>
For anyone wanting to understand what I'm asking here, they can just read page 3 in the above-mentioned thread.  You don't have to read the whole thread but can if you want to.<br>
<br>
As you will see, Buster came along and made some comments asserting that support for Sandboxie has been less since Invincea took it over.  Apparently, he has made similar negative comments in other threads.  Since that is also my perception, I agreed with him.  In the last comment addressed to Buster from Curt he said "I see no point in you continuing to harp on this over and over again" then closed the thread.<br>
<br>
While I can understand Buster may have been "harping" on the same issue, why was <strong><em>my</em></strong> thread closed?  Why was <strong><em>I</em></strong> penalized?</div>

				<div class="content">Well errr... 83 days and 208 views later and no reply from Curt.  I don't suppose he's blind nor is there a way to hide those facts.  It's a sorry situation really.</div>

				<div class="content">There is nothing left to discuss on this issue at this time.  As I said before, even if SbieCtrl.exe were to crash and all the Sbie services crash with it. the sandboxed app is still sandboxed -- until it most likely crashes as well.<br>
<br>
Try it yourself.  Bring up a browser in Sbie.  Now kill SbieCtrl.exe and all Sbie services in task manager.  Now save images, downloads, etc. in the sandboxed browser.</div>

Do you think I was born yesterday.  Do you really want me to believe that's the reason you closed my thread?  Is that the way Invincea does things?  Man, you really have a lot to learn.  I hope one day the bosses at Invincea find out how you run this forum.</div>

Thanks for the feedback.  Invincea contact information is at invincea.com.  Please take the time to voice your complaints with management.  I insist.<br>
<br>
If we can find someone else that has a problem with every Sbie binary silently disappearing, we will look into it.<br>
<br>
The reason I closed the thread is right there in the last post on that thread.  That is the only thread I have ever closed.   But this may be the 2nd.</div>

				<div class="content">If Sandboxie Control is not running when you are running a sandboxed program, Joe's symptoms are reproduced. I don't know if that is by design or not. Everything stays sandboxed. Solution - Configure&gt;Windows Shell Integration&gt;Start Sandboxie Control&gt;Check one or both of the two boxes. If that solution doesn't work then Joe has something installed that is periodically closing Sandboxie Control.</div>

				<div class="content">Okay, let analyze this.  You say the reason why you closed my thread is "right there in the last post on that thread".  To make it simple, this is what you said...<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Curt@invincea wrote:</cite>Ok, Buster. Invincea appreciates all feedback, good or bad. You have made your point -- many times. I see no point in you continuing to harp on this over and over again.<br>
<br>
So this thread is closed. If you have any complaints, you are free to voice them somewhere else on the Internet, or email Invincea directly.</div></blockquote>

...and now this is what you say in this thread...<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Curt@invincea wrote:</cite>That is the only thread I have ever closed.   But this may be the 2nd.</div></blockquote>

So first you wrongfully penalize me and now you are threatening to close this thread.  I have no doubt that as the Lead Developer for Sandboxie you must be doing a great job but you fail as a forum moderator.  If you carry out your threat to close this thread you will just be furthering your abuse of power.  No one likes to be told they are wrong but unless you confront your mistakes you will never improve.  I hope for your sake you find the strength to change and become a better moderator.  This is all I have to say.</div>
