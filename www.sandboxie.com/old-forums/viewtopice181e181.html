Looking good here in XP and W7. I watch videos and tested streaming sports games last night, all went well using Firefox. Nice work, Curt. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>

				<div class="content">We are still unable to repro any problems with dropped rights and Chrome here.  Therefor, we are going to turn 4.13.7 into 14.4 ASAP so that we have a released version that works with Chrome 37/38 (32 &amp; 64).  Then we will make another stab at the dropped rights problems.  Since Google has disabled any type of crash handling (for unknown reasons), Sbie will probably have to do it for them in 4.15.1 so we can diagnose this.<br>
<br>
BTW, Chrome 39 Beta (64 bit) even works now (knock on wood).  So hopefully soon we can actually work on something besides Chrome!  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>

I don't disable Services unless there is a good reason. I looked at my Services and that Service is set to start Automatically and it is currently running. Perhaps you should take a look at your Services and see how it is set. Also, you might want to test using a new sandbox with default settings to see if you still get the problem. Good luck. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>

Thank you for trying Bo. It only happens on the system I have Windows 8.1 x64 on. The one with Windows 8.1 x86 is working as it should.<br>
<br>
On both I have to disable the Drop Rights in order to be able to use Chrome though. Would you guys suggest to disable the Chrome Update in order to make it work 100% in the future (so that the updates won't cause conflicts with Sandboxie again)?</div>

I wouldn't go that far.  As I said, Chrome 39 Beta currently works with 4.13.7.  So hopefully we won't have an onslaught of Chrome sandbox incompatibilities at least for a while.</div>

Invincea thanks all of the 4.13 Beta testers.<br>
<br>
Chrome sandbox compatibility was a major issue in this release (in case you haven't heard  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> ).  There is still an issue with dropped rights for some people.  If you are using dropped rights and Chrome crashes, just disable dropped rights for now.  We will be working on this problem now.</div>

Same here, but at least this time a warning box came up after a while so I could cancel Flash and not lose all my other tabs with it locking up completely.</div>
