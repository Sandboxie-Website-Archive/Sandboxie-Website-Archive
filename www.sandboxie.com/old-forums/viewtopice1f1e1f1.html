				<div class="content">I can't say how much time this has saved me from cleaning viruses off of my PC.  Going online is dicey at best and this software makes going online much more secure.  I try and convince my friends to use it but of course, they know better, that is until they call me to help them clean up their PC's.<br>
<br>
The ability to terminate the sandbox once something has tried to take over your PC is invaluable.</div>

<br>
Thanks for the feedback!  Did you know that Sandboxie can also be used to run any application in isolation in addition to your web browser?  Some uses include: testing out shareware by installing into a sandbox so you don't pollute your system if you don't want to buy, running Java games in a sandbox (like Minecraft), running multiple games in different sandboxes for different user profiles, and more!<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>
Chris<br>
