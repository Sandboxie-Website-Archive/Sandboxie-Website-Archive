				<div class="content">The second problem is expected.  Sandboxie scans and remembers drive letter information when a sandboxed program comes up, and this doesn't get refreshed later on.<br>
<br>
This could be improved in a later version, perhaps, but I won't deal with that now. <br>
<br>
As for the first problem:  With TrueCrypt I was also able to reproduce this problem.  I mounted drive T:, started a sandboxed command prompt, typed dir T: and I get<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
 Volume in drive T has no label.<br>
 Volume Serial Number is 45E9-C634<br>
<br>
 Directory of T:\<br>
<br>
File Not Found
</div></blockquote>

Then I unmounted the drive and typed dir T: in the sandboxed cmd:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
The system cannot find the file specified.
</div></blockquote>

However, TrueCrypt displays drive U: twice, in other words, its display of drives got messed up to display U: instead of T:.<br>
<br>
As soon as I exit the sandboxed cmd, the TrueCrypt display is corrected.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
If I use Process Explorer to look into a sandboxed app, I see it holds open handles for the drives available when the app started.  This may be what is keeping the drive from being ultimately unmounted.  I'll see if this is something I can fix.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
(Later)  Yes, that was it, and there was no reason to keep the handles open.  I fixed it now, thanks.</div>
