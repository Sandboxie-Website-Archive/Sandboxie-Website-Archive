				<div class="content">Hey there, I am trying out this neat software and have ran into an issue with a suspicious Unity game I have downloaded.<br>
<br>
I've put the entire game folder, including the executable and Data folder into a folder in my sandbox, but the sandbox seems to be having issues with locating the Data folder. When I try to run the game, I get the error: "Data folder not found, folder should be next to the executable."<br>
<br>
Does anyone have experience or advice with dealing with this problem? Many thanks for any help.</div>

<br>
Installing games inside the Sandbox may or may not work. If the game installs drivers/services, those will not work inside Sandboxie (thus, you will have to install the game on your host and then run it Sandboxed). <br>
If the game installation went thru, you will find the files inside the Container folder (typically C:\Sandbox\Username\SandboxName\Game-Path_Selected).</div>
