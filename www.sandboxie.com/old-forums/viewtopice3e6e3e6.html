				<h3>EAC compatibility</h3>

				<div class="content">Me and my wife have been using Aster v7 to allow us two independent desktops in my Windows 10 environment. Most games works in the sandbox, however, games using EAC as well as Punkbuster do not work. It has something to do with the anti-cheat softwares requiring interaction with their associated windows services. <br>
<br>
My feature request would be a compatibility feature (such as the ones for Comodo, 7zip, etc.) Which would allow EAC and Punkbuster to work with sandboxie games simply by clicking the check box. I have been banging my head against a wall trying to find a way around this issue for more than a year now. <br>
<br>
P.S. Private message me as I would also be willing to donate a substantial amount of money for this feature.</div>

				<div class="content">Applications that require Services to be installed my be blocked by SBIE. <br>
<br>
Programs that require separate drivers simply will not work with SBIE. That's not possible at all.<br>
<br>
Also, more and more online game hosts are flagging SBIE as a "cheat" program as well as it's being used for purposes it wasn't directly intended for.<br>
<br>
Usually, the only other option is to install the software on your host and then right click and select "Run as sandboxed."</div>

				<div class="content">PunkBuster makes use of a service so it won't work from 'only inside' a sandbox, don't recall if it made use of a driver. Either way, the game may run (if punkbuster is installed on the host meaning it can see everything that is sandboxed or not), but running multiple instances of the same program and not having it get flagged is highly unlikely and I don't see how any sort of template could help there.<br>
<br>
I haven't dealt with punkbuster since my Q3A days [didn't like it then but I hated the aimbot users more] but I doubt it's gotten any 'nicer' in the way it works, if anything it's likely gotten more intrusive. That was prolly 10+ years ago so I'd hate to see what it harvests today. I'm not familiar with 'EAC'. /me suddenly feels old</div>
