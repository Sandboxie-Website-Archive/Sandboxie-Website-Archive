				<div class="content">The motto "Trust no program" has become a rule for me, I strictly follow it and it works. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>
<br>
What do I mean? I run sandboxed all programs and files that run in my computer and I am good. Thats what I made of the Trust no program motto and I ll tell you, if you do what I am saying, you wont get infected. Of course, sometimes you have to install something in your real system, at that time then I bend the rule a little and install the program if its well known, legal, and feel pretty certain that the installer is clean. <br>
<br>
I taken the Trust no program thing a little further and I also don't trust any webpage. I don't care what kind of website it is, I don't trust it. So I run every site that I visit in a sandbox and don't white list sites in NoScript. Thats it, that's really all I do to keep my systems clean.<br>
<br>
Doing the above works for me. I am not a computer guy, don't use antiviruses or scanners of any kind and don't get infected. I feel great and relaxed using computers and the internet the way I do and all started by using SBIE and following the motto "Trust no program".<br>
