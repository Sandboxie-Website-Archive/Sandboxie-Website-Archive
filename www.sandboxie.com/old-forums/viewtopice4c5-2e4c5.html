Thanks but I don't run any AV. Currently it seems to be running fine but I will keep my eye on it. I also don't have any Roboform toolbars running in my browser (Firefox).</div>

I'd keep an eye on whatever that is, Some searches state it's part of Avast (in working with Roboform) so, unless you have one of those installed, I'd say disable it.</div>

				<div class="content">This post is a FYI kind of post to Sandboxie users. I read the Release notes for Firefox 41.0.1, one of the fixes is for potential hangs with the Flash plugin. This past few days, I have had that happen 3 or 4 times while using my XP. None in W7 but I don't keep Flash as an installed program in W7. So, if you had any problem lately with Flash running Firefox sandboxed, updating Firefox to 41.0.1 should fix the issue.<br>

All the below comments are for Sandboxie 5.04 RC.<br>
<br>
Starting games from Steam does not work, I've verified this with plain old counter strike. The game briefly shows up in the sandbox running hl2.exe then it terminates without warning or error. You mentioned in the beginning when the issue was first reported this could be related to DX12 but did not provide any details since.<br>
<br>
As for Slack, the latest slack installer (v1.2.2 MD5: a2eeedf797796ee298980f49416aa26b) does not work either (just downloaded and tried to install in a brand new, empty sandbox). The error I'm seeing is:<br>
<em>SBIE2224 Sandboxed program has crashed: SlackSetup.exe</em><br>
<br>
I don't expect MS to call you but given that there were Win10 builds months before the actual RTM I would have expected to see a more mature version of sandboxie sooner.<br>
<br>
I'm happy to provide logs or whatever you need to resolve the issues if you can tell me where Sandboxie stores debug information.</div>

<br>
As for Steam, it won't be possible to get every game to run in a SB. It depends on what the game requires outside of the SB. Some games will refuse to run in a sandbox.<br>
<br>
It's  not just a Win10 issue..or a Windows issue. <br>
<br>
As for "mature" I'd disagree. The <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">core criteria</span></em></strong> of SBIE works wonderfully. SBIE is v5.04 release is a stable, mature release.</div>
