				<h3>Different ideas about launching programs.</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Tue Aug 16, 2011 1:12 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I would like to see an option to force certain programs to popup the "Which Sandbox" window each time.<br>
And add a checkbox to the window that pops up if you click to run it outside of a sandbox so you never get asked that again. <br>
And I'd like it if the "Which Sandbox window" had it where you could just click the sandbox name to launch it in a particular sandbox, or have certain programs associated with a certain sandbox, and have that box highlighted when the window pops up, and you can just click OK.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just a way where I can click once on a shortcut to a program then once to chose in a sandbox or outside of a sandbox (Or maybe even 2 clicks for outside the sandbox),  and I'm done, and the program is running.<br>
<br>
<br>
I've got it now where I setup some of my shortcuts to pop open this window, but it's still inconvenient to have to change so many, and I still have to select a different box and hit okay. Or select run outside and hit okay in 2 windows. If any of the features already exist or some way of doing what I'm wanting to do now, please let me know. Thank you.</div>
