				<div class="content">I'm about to install windows on my mac and I have a quick question. I know I can in theory idle 10 accounts at a time but is it 10 accounts a day or 10 accounts a week? Can I have 100 sandboxie accounts and use 10 each day?<br>
Thanks and don't make fun of me.</div>

				<div class="content">It's not about the number of accounts, it about items per account. An account can get new items every week, so if you get everything in a single day, you can get more items the next week when the server resets. If you want to get items every day for 10 different accounts, then you'd need only 60-70 accounts. Also, keep in mind that even in text mode, tf2 requires some memory and you may not be able to sustain 10 accounts simultaneously, unless you keep a PC dedicated for such task.</div>
