I was saying, if this proxy re-routing that you want to have, if this is something that is configurable via the registry.<br>
<br>
If so then I am suggesting that in a future version, Sandboxie will be able to automatically apply registry settings from a .REG file into the sandbox.</div>

<br>
well i'm using tor or other proxies some times, but i hate to change settings all the time, would be nice if i could put a setting in sandboxie (eg: SocksProxy=127.0.0.1:9050) then sandboxie would make sure all internet access from every program that runs inside is going through that proxie instead of a direct connection.<br>
<br>
i have no clue if that's possible with registry settings, i'm not that familiar with the internal workings of windows... but maybe it's just a simple (registry?) setting related to internet explorer (at least i know i need to run IE once on my pc for other programs to recognize an internet  connection at all, for example firefox won't work,at least on my pc, unless i ran IE once after clean windows install)</div>

				<div class="content">Once I create the feature to auto-import registry settings, I'm sure finding the specific IE (or Firefox or whatever) registry setting will be fairly easy.<br>
<br>
(That is, if the browser app is configurable through the registry, which in most cases, I suppose it would be.)</div>

maybe there's a fairly easy way to make that option in the sandbox config?<br>

i hope you understand what i mean.</div>

i'm sorry if i don't understand what you're saying correctly,<br>
<br>
you're saying that all traffic from sandboxed programs can be routed through the proxy by changing one 'simple' setting in the sandbox-registry that affects all applications in the box?<br>
independant from the program settings itsself?</div>

				<div class="content">No, no ... I was saying that I'm going to make it possible to ask Sandboxie:<br>
<br>
Every time a sandbox is created (for example after deletion), then please automatically import these registry (.REG) files into the sandbox.<br>
<br>
Then it's going to be to up to <em>you</em> to figure out how your particular software of choice (proxy, whatever) can be configured to behave in the sandbox in the way you want it.  Then export that configuration to a .REG file.  It's very easy with RegEdit once you know what to export.<br>
<br>
And you could have Sandboxie automatically apply these settings for you.<br>
<br>
So in a way it's going to be a solution to what you want -- to not having to configure manually -- but I'm only going to give a generic way to do this, and you're going to have to fill in the details.<br>
<br>
Now ok?</div>

all i could find was:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>REGEDIT4
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings]

				<div class="content">For me that worked just fine.  I copy-pasted your lines exactly into c:\proxy.reg and added:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>AutoImportReg=c:\proxy.reg
</code></pre></div>

And then I started sandboxed IE, and it caused the proxy configuration to change to 127.0.0.1:9050.  I also couldn't browse anymore (I don't have a proxy server on port 9050), so I assume it actually does work.<br>
<br>
Did you save the .reg file as Unicode?  You have to, otherwise regedit silently ignores it.</div>

				<div class="content">tzuk, indeed that works for internet exploiter, but not for all the other programs im running sandboxed (except for msn, it takes the settings from IE).<br>
<br>
but my mirc and firefox just refuse to even take a look at general internet settings and access the web directly</div>

				<div class="content">So I revised the setting that it may be more versatile.<br>
<br>
It's now  AutoExec and can run any program as part of <em>sandbox customization</em>.<br>
<br>
You can still import registry:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>AutoExec=regedit /s c:\proxy.reg
</code></pre></div>

But you can also prepare other configuration files, for example:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>AutoExec=cmd /c copy c:\ProxifiedFirefox\firefox.conf "%Appdata%\Mozilla\Firefox\profiles\YourProfile.default\FirefoxConfigurationFile.ini"
</code></pre></div>

You just need to find out which Firefox configuration file it would be ...<br>
<br>
I hope it helps then...</div>
