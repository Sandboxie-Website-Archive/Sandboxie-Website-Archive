				<div class="content">We are considering updating Sandboxie's user interface.  I would like feedback from the users as to what you consider important or unimportant in the current interface, and what you would like to see in a new interface. The goal is not merely to add fancy graphics, bells and whistles, etc., but to make Sandboxie cleaner, easier to use, more powerful, etc.<br>
<br>
How many of you currently use "Files and Folders" off of the View menu? This same tree structure is available from Windows Explorer by drilling down into the Sandbox folder. But do you like to have it available in SbieCtrl, or should we just eliminate it?<br>

I've never used this view, ever. Frankly I don't know whether it's a good idea to remove it or leave it to those who actually use it.</div>

I never use the Files and Folders view and prefer to use Windows explorer when I want to see whats inside the Sandbox folder. I personally wouldn't miss that view at all if it was done away with.<br>

I actually use this quite a bit, I like that I can right click a folder or file and have it "Recover to Same Folder", such as an ini file or whatever, it's also easier on the eyes then clicking through a maze of folders and juggling two or more windows using windows explorer. So I would stronger disagree with the removal of it, but it can use some quality of life improvements for sure.<br>
<br>
I'll have more for suggestions later, but one that comes imminently to mind is to combine both the "Programs" and "Files and Folder" Views into one window for a given Sandbox, I really hate how I have to choose which one I want to see, there is so much dead space in the SB Control window that you can easily split a line down the middle and have the "Programs" View on one side and "Files and Folder" View on the other side, this would eliminate the tedium of having to switch between those two views.<br>
<br>
Having more mouse control would be great too, what I mean is being able to drag and drop files out of Sandboxie from the Sandboxie Control window or double clicking on the folder/file would open a explorer window of the given location for quicker access.<br>
<br>
Right clicking a file, there should be a delete button too! I would use this a lot, I'm shocked you have something like "cut" but not delete. <a href="../i.imgur.com/CPPfy5J.png" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/CPPfy5J.png</a><br>
<br>
I guess the reason the people above me don't use this window much is because you can't do much with it, less then you can do with explorer anyway, it's also sorta clunky to use.<br>
<br>
More info given to the user would be great too, but this is more added feature then streamline usability. an example would be <a href="../i.imgur.com/pHPASVt.png" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/pHPASVt.png</a><br>
Showing the user at quick glance what's new or something by highlighting, or just show a generic sort by creation/modified date list, I dunno.<br>
<br>
Now for a selfish feature I would really love to see, this isn't really a Sandbox (Security) thing, but a way to view the RegHive natively, you could add this info to the "Programs" View stuff. Just something simple is all that is needed, after all Sandboxie is used to trap but also monitor how program interact, monitoring file creation is easy enough, but created reg keys is also important imo. Currently I use RegistryViewer v1.3 for this feature, but I'm trying to eliminate tedium for myself with is request by not having to load up and rely on 3rd part stuff in order to work with Sandboxie. <br>
<br>
Peace Out.</div>

<br>
Right clicking the little taskbar Sandbox icon, there should be some kind of indicator of activity and whether it's empty or has files in it for each of your Sandboxes, something like this.<br>
<br>
<a href="../i.imgur.com/tIy8K89.png" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/tIy8K89.png</a><br>
<br>
Currently you have no way of knowing if your need to empty one out unless you manually check. The Green dot could mean that Sandbox is "active", a red could mean it's not active but there are files in it.</div>

With regard to the GUI in general, I personally wouldn't want to see any updates or changes.  I think it's as simple as it needs to be, and certainly doesn't need any "bells and whistles".<br>
<br>
However, if you really feel it will add to your sales or what not, any changes made is unlikely to be a deal-breaker for me.<br>
<br>
Just my opinions though.</div>

I'm working on tabs. Each sandbox will be in a tab window that you can position however you like to see real-time activity.<br>
<br>
I'm not a big fan of ribbons. Especially with multiple languages.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked">  I'm leaning towards an old-school toolbar. The fewer clicks the better.</div>

I'm not a big fan of ribbons either, but 1) I thought I'd throw in it there and 2) now and again for certain programs a non-ribbon interface feels a bit archaic.

I agree with ssj100. <br>
<br>
I think getting rid of the Files and Folders view is fine but would prefer major changes not to take place with the GUI. It works great the way it is, simple, no bugs. Perhaps adding the Tab design for individual sandboxes would be OK but I would rather most everything else to remain as is now.<br>
