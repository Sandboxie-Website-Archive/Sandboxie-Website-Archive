				<h3>Run a program under SB - no way to cancel?</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sat Feb 24, 2018 6:30 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">If I want to run a program within SB, and then change my mind, I don't think there's any elegant way to back out. AFAIK, I must continue to launch the program and then close the program.<br>
<br>
Here's an example using Chrome.<br>
<br>
 - Start Chrome as follows:  R-click on desktop icon &gt; Run Sandboxed<br>
 - The small "Run Sandboxed" dialog appears. Click OK.<br>
 - The bigger "Sandboxie" dialog appears.<br>
<br>
And now, there's no way to back out. The "x" at top right does not respond.<br>
AFAIK, the only option now is to click "Click to close this window and continue"<br>
<br>
Does anyone know how to back out of this process?<br>
<br>
Thanks.</div>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>- The bigger "Sandboxie" dialog appears. </div></blockquote>
---&gt; What does this dialog display? At this point the application should be starting, and it can be closed like any other app by clicking on the X at the top right corner.<br>
<br>
You can also right-click on your Sandbox via Sandboxie Control and select "Terminate Programs". OR, you can right-click on the desired program that is running in the Sandbox and select "Terminate Program" .<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"Click to close this window and continue"</div></blockquote>
Is this the screen that you get when using the free version of Sandboxie? <br>
<br>

				<div class="content">The attached screenshot shows the first and second dialog in sequence.<br>
<br>
When the second dialog is presented, there's no way to cancel, or back out.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Barb wrote:</cite>What does this dialog display?</div></blockquote>

See second screenshot, which relates to "Licence Manager"<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Barb wrote:</cite>At this point the application should be starting, and it can be closed like any other app by clicking on the X at the top right corner.</div></blockquote>

Clicking on the "X" at top right has no effect. <br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Barb wrote:</cite>You can also right-click on your Sandbox via Sandboxie Control and select "Terminate Programs". OR, you can right-click on the desired program that is running in the Sandbox and select "Terminate Program" .</div></blockquote>

During the time when the Licence Manager is displayed, "Terminate Programs" has no effect, because at that stage there are no sandboxed applications running (Chrome is always my first application to be run sandboxed).<br>
<br>
All this stuff is just for info. I think we can safely close this ticket. I've been using SB for about 50 years, and I only wanted to abort once a few days ago. <br>
<br>
If it's easy to add some code to activate the "X" control at top right, then go ahead. Otherwise, I can simply continue the SB process, then use "Terminate Programs". I need the exercise anyway.<br>

<br>
As explained in the screenshot, that second screen appears when you have installed Sandboxie more than 30 days ago, and pauses it for a few seconds, thus you cannot perform any actions during that time (and until you close the window).<br>
<br>
This is a restriction of the free version. You cannot bypass it. <br>
<br>

Sorry for my bad English. <br>
<br>
I'm not trying to bypass the restriction  <img alt="ðŸ˜ƒ" class="emoji smilies" draggable="false" src="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/svg/1f603.svg"><br>
<br>
I'm trying to ABORT the SB process by clicking the "X" at top right. The complete "expected" procedure would be as follows.<br>
<br>
Start configuration:<br>
<br>
 - Chrome is not open<br>
 - SB is not open<br>
<br>
Procedure:<br>
<br>
1) R-click on the Chrome icon on the desktop. Select "Run Sandboxed"<br>
2) The dialog shown in first screenshot opens. Click OK.<br>
3) The Licence Manager opens. <br>
4) Change my mind. Click "X" at top right.<br>
5) The licence dialog closes<br>
<br>
End configuration (same as start configuration):<br>
<br>
 - Chrome is not open<br>
 - SB is not open<br>
<br>
But, as I said earlier, I'm quite happy to continue with the current SB functionality. Can we close this thread now? In fact, it might be a good idea to simply delete this post. If you're confused - a lot of other people might also be confused for no value added.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help.<br>
