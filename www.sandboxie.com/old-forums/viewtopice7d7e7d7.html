				<div class="content">I'm running Sandboxie 5.04 on Windows 10 64bit with Firefox 41.0.2.<br>
<br>
One annoying issue I seem to be having intermittently is that when I download files (no matter what size), when it gets to the end of the download Firefox becomes unresponsive and I have to "end task" it and relaunch it. This only happens when downloading files. It doesn't happen every time so its intermittent.<br>
<br>
In Firefox my download folder is set to D:\Downloads and in Sandboxie for the sandbox I run Firefox in I have added D:\Downloads to the File Access - Direct Access section.<br>
<br>
Is there anything I can do to fix this annoying problem? Firefox only (intermittently) crashes in the sandbox when I download something.<br>

Thanks!</div>

I would update to the newest release candidate. I'm surprised your are not seeing other issues given the patch Tuesday problems that MS caused on the 14th. I would grab the RC here <a href="../index05f1.html?DownloadSandboxie" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?DownloadSandboxie</a></div>

The only issues I have been having have been with Firefox crashing when downloading files and I also find my minimise/maximise/close buttons on Firefox looks strange (possibly because I run a Firefox theme?).<br>
<br>
I have installed RC 5.06 so will see how this goes and report back if I have any further issues with Firefox hanging.</div>

v5.06 is the RC (re-naming) of the last beta, nothing was changed in regards to FF and downloads.<br>
<br>
Glad its working.</div>

You can test running Firefox with no addons (create new Firefox profile) in a new sandbox. Perhaps you ll experience no crashes using it and your minimize/maximize/close buttons start looking normal again. Is possible the theme you are using and or another addon, or a sandbox setting you are using is messing things up.<br>

				<div class="content">Good thinking. I have created a fresh new Firefox profile. No addons or extensions. As soon as I install the Brushed Metal theme my minimise/maximise/close buttons go all "white" and look weird with the theme. If I run the same Firefox profile unsandboxed then the buttons look fine with the theme so theres clearly an issue with Sandboxie and Firefox?<br>
<br>
I'll test downloading some files and see if it still hangs/becomes unrepsonsive.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help!<br>
<br>
Edit: With my fresh Firefox profile and no addons or extensions installed the browser has just become unresponsive and the only thing to do is terminate it and relaunch it. This was after downloading about 5 or 6 files less than 15MB each. So even with a fresh brand new Firefox profile I am having stability issues with Firefox when downloading files when it is sandboxed. The file that caused Firefox to become unresponsive was only 902KB. We're not talking about gigabyte size files here...most of my downloads are utilties/tools/etc and aren't very big in size. It doesn't seem to make any difference if I download one or five files at the same time. In either situation the browser can become unresponsive while downloading. FYI: While doing this testing of the downloads I did NOT have ANY themes installed.<br>
<br>
What now?<br>
<br>
Second edit: Heres what the buttons look like. First image is in the sandbox and second one is unsandboxed:<br>

There is a transition in animations from the Fx download arrow to the Sbie flashing Recovery Box that may be the issue.<br>

I have three unique sandboxes and they're all behaving the same way with Firefox: Download starts and the Firefox becomes unrepsonsive towards the end of the download. The download usually completes but the browser needs to be restarted.<br>
<br>
I can try yet another new sandbox wih Firefox tomorrow but I doubt it'll help. I'll report back tomorrow hopefully.</div>

I'm glad this isn't just happening to me! What you have described is pretty much how I have been experiencing downloads with Firefox running in a sandbox. I'm running 5.06 currently but it was also happening in 5.04.<br>
<br>
Is this a bug that need addressing?</div>

That doesn't sound like a good idea, Joe (remember, October's Windows updates breaks SBIE).<br>

Could it have affected the Firefox downloads? I tried a fresh new sandbox with a new Firefox profile and the downloads still cause Firefox to sometimes become unresponsive.<br>
<br>
What are the options here?</div>
