				<div class="content">HI, if you run an external hard drive in a sandboxie mode  you can copy files from the hard drive to the desktop safely, but is it possible to copy files from the desktop to the  external hard drive opened in a sandboxie?<br>
I tried with copy/paste but when i reconnect the hard drive the files are disappeared...</div>

				<div class="content">Try allowing Direct file access to a folder inside the external hard drive or to the HD itself. I would do it to a folder or a few folders. I don't have an external HD but just tested doing this with a USB drive and it works fine.<br>
<br>
Sandbox settings&gt;Resource access&gt;File access&gt;Direct access, Add the folder or the external drive<br>

Ok, but if there are some viruses in the external hard drive they can't infect the desktop, right?</div>

If you run the external hard drive sandboxed and not recover any viruses to the desktop, you wont get infected.<br>

Hi James, I am no malware expert but I think if you have malware somewhere in the external hard drive, it is likely it can access the rest of the hard drive, including the empty folder. Allowing or not access to the empty folder wouldn't make a difference in that regard.<br>
<br>
I think what you should try to do is clean the external hard drive of viruses and restrict the sandbox so malware from the external hard drive cant get to your Desktop. In Sandbox settings for the sandbox where you are forcing the hard drive, forbid all programs from having access to the internet, allow only a few programs to run and block programs running in the sandboxed hard drive from having access to your personal and sensitive files and folders in the Desktop..<br>

				<div class="content">James, I forgot. In Sandbox settings for the sandbox where you are forcing the external HD, you should enable Drop rights.<br>
<br>
And also, when you do the cleanup, while you are doing it you can set things up to block all programs from running out of the hard drive. You wont find a setting specifically made for doing that in Sandbox settings&gt;Restrictions&gt;Start/Run access but that's what you ll achieve if you add something like "James" in that window. If you add James there, only a program named james.exe would be allowed to run. So, do this before the cleanup but whatever you do, be careful if you have malware in the HD.<br>
