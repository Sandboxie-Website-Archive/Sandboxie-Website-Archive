Do you have Opera installed directly in the Sandbox?  I saw a similar post yesterday:<br>

Thank you for your response. We need information in order to reproduce the issues and see what's going on. <br>
So far, I have not been able to repro it (I am currently setting up another VM and updating Win 7 to test again). <br>
<br>
Is the issue only happening when using the uTorrent ? If not, can you provide another example? (I will install uTorrent once I am done installing Windows Updates) .<br>
<br>
I saw your response on the other topic, so it looks like you have Opera installed outside the Sandbox (which is what I tested before).<br>
<br>
Regards.</div>

With uTorrent is now with no problems, but the error is not corrected until the end!<br>

<br>
UPDATE:<br>
<br>
I registered, hit "Reply" to a random topic and tried uploading a picture by clicking "Photos" at the top.  <br>
Selected Choose Files and the File Upload window appeared.<br>
I was able to select a picture, no crashes (but the picture did not seem to upload, I cannot test it 100% since cannot post a test image to their forums..).<br>
<br>
Then I used the "Chose file option" from the bottom of their page ---&gt; Crashed when I selected the picture.<br>
<strong>This happened only once, right after I installed Opera</strong>. I have not been able to reproduce it ever since (using the latest beta of Sandboxie, please give it a try if you haven't already).<br>
<br>
Does it happen all the time for you?  )<br>
<br>

Please try these steps and see if this alleviates the issue: <br>
Right click on your Sandbox ---&gt; Sandbox settings<br>

Clear the Cache in Opera.<br>

Not sure what do you mean. Is utorrent working or not working for you?<br>
<br>
I am still trying to get this issue to occur again, aside from that one time, I was never able to reproduce it.<br>
Can you try clearing the cache in Opera and then running it Sandboxed? <br>
<br>
Do you happen to have McAfee installed?  (Or any other antivirus software?) <br>
<br>
