<br>
Are you a bit scared when you have to give control of your computer to someone?<br>
<br>
I needed help establishing IPSEC VPN connection between some offices and ended up with telling the router support "here, you try it if you think it works".<br>
<br>
So I started Teamviewer in a sandbox. And the browser in which they were to work in the same sandbox.<br>
<br>
That way, they could work in that particular browser instance, but could not click outside the sandbox. Sure, they could *see* outside the sandbox, but not click. Plus, they needed to upload a config file - again, no worries because that too happened inside that sandbox.<br>
<br>
That was a year ago, and I have since taught the company owners, both well into their 70s to ALWAYS start Teamviewer in Sandboxie. And a few weeks ago, one of them got hit by a "support" scammer who installed ransomware on his home computer. You know, black screen that can't be closed, red notice about how many Bitcoins to pay. Well, I just hit "Terminate all programs" in Sandboxie and it was gone. And yes, he told me to buy Sandboxie for his entire family.<br>
<br>
Just thought I would share this. It's maybe an unexpected use case to use it with a remote-control program, but I find it very useful.</div>
