				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
1) when sandboxie is autoloaded it could execute (or ask for it) the applications in autorun key of registry and in autorun folder.<br>
2) the previous problem showed another problem:<br>
since programs aren't auto loaded I had to load an application manually but when I tryed to run explorer it wasn't loaded, likely because it was mistaken for the desktop manager (already loaded of course) so I had to use an alternative file manager.<br>
could you add a workaround?<br>
<br>
Best regards.</div>

				<div class="content">1) go to each registry key you want to have sandboxed and eg.<br>
Instead of<br>
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\TESTAPP=c:\test.exe<br>
you could change it to:<br>
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\TESTAPP="%programfiles%\sandboxie\start.exe" "c:\test.exe"<br>
(both in quotes)<br>
Don't worry, on most windows systems the %programfiles% will replace itself.<br>
<br>
2) I don't know what you mean (I probably read it too quickly)</div>

				<div class="content">Oh, yes. 2. If you type "explorer /s" instead of just "explorer" it might work.</div>

				<div class="content">answer 2 worked, though I'd prefer explorer wouldn't open the size it pleases...<br>
about the former question the reply doesn't fit.<br>
I'd like that when sandboxie is started, it would process the sandboxed registry keys which would autorun programs at windows startup.<br>
Let's say you install an application.<br>
Sometime the installer sets some key under runonce to complete the installation, so if sandboxie handles that the install can be completed correctly after a reboot.<br>
That isn't the only case.<br>
If I for eg. install winamp inside sandbox it should puts on tray an agent optionally, but when you restart windows and sandboxie is started that agent isn't started anymore because... autostart isn't managed.<br>
<br>
Anyway thanks for your reply</div>

That's a good idea, so I'm putting this on my to-do list.<br>
<br>
For the time being, you'll have to make this work manually.  I think score_under gave a good explanation how to do it.</div>
