				<div class="content">Make sure you have Comodo internet security/antivirus/firewall box ticked [+] in sandboxie control/configure/software compatibility. <br>
<br>
Mine was unchecked even though i thought it was when i first got the prompt on sandboxie installer.<br>
<br>
Also add the entire sandboxie folder to "detect shellcode injection" exclusion list. Located Defence+/Hips/Hips settings/under advanced.<br>
<br>
Previously nothing would run. Not even an error. Put sandboxie folder into exception. I got an error at least. Then ticked compatibility and things seem to run no problem so far.</div>

				<div class="content">Henry, I don't use an antivirus but the one that I know that has worked very well with SBIE for many many years with no conflict at any time for at least 5 years is MSE or Windows defender now. If I was using an AV, thats the one I would use and is the one I recommend and install in friends and family who are using SBIE. I installed MSE  in friends computer who had licenses for paid antiviruses after uninstalling the paid one. <br>

				<div class="content">My KIS license runs out in a few weeks, but I worry about MSE as even Microsoft says, to paraphrase, it's not much good; and when last I looked it did pretty miserably in independent tests. Bitdefender would have been my second choice, but that is no good with Win10/Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
I've installed a trial of AVG (excluding Sandboxie as advised) on my laptop which I updated to Windows 10 and will see how it goes, but I may stay with KIS and Win 7 on my main desktop pc. I'll run into a deadline with the free Win10 upgrade but perhaps they will play (more) nicely by then. How many people don't upgrade an OS because of a little utility program? <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes"> <br>
<br>
Thanks for the recommendations nonetheless.</div>

				<div class="content">i understand your concerns. <br>
<br>
But most AV is reactive at best. Using SBIE, even if you do get infected, you simply delete the contents of the SB and move on. Every-time we've purposely tested a system running SBIE and on known infected sites, MSE/Defender have detected the intrusion. We then delete the contents. Nothing get's out of the SB.<br>
<br>
I've tested the entire Panda suite and had good results, but for general AV, Defender is what Curt and I use, but again, we're using SBIE.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Craig<br>
<br>
I agree with most of what you say but, while all my online browsing is sandboxed, there are some things I cannot (Office 365 - any action here?) or do not want to (Thunderbird) run sandboxed. Opening attachments in Office 365 is a particular concern even though it has its own protections.<br>
<br>
However good Sandboxie is, I will always want a strong AV/IS suite - you just can't be certain in this day and age.</div>

				<div class="content">Symantec (and Norton) seem to be working well with SBIE. Personally, at home, I'm using Norton (free from Comcast Xfinity) and I'm happy with it. Originally, it was used to test given the large  Customer base &amp; I was curious, but I found it simply works and plays nice with SBIE.<br>
<br>
Panda suite also well works without issues with SBIE. So those (2) are my personal top (free) ones that I use.</div>
