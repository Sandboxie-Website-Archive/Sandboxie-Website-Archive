				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Fri Sep 04, 2015 5:07 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>sandbear</strong></div>
				<div class="content">My situation: I use my notebook (Windows XP) to teach chess to children. And those children may use the chess program, but they should not use anything else. <br>
<br>
First solution: Create a Windows user with limited rights. But the disadvantage is, that I have to look for various things of my own user account, too. <br>
<br>
Best solution: I would like a program (similar to sandboxie) that allows the user to use only the program that was started in the sandbox. All other mouse and keyboard actions should be impossible until this protection is switched off by typing a password. <br>
<br>
Does anybody know, whether this feature is available in sandboxie or is there any other program which can do this?<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help!</div>

With the paid version of SBIE, you can "force" any programs to to start in a sandbox. As for the mouse / keyboard part of it...that's something SBIE doesn't do, but I'm sure you can find a program that could do that in addition.</div>

<br>
Consider something like Shadowdefender.    Once shadowed it doesn't matter what they do.  Reboot and system is back to normal</div>
