				<div class="content">I suggest you call the nearest Cleverbridge office to where you live and ask them. When I purchased my license, I bought it in an unconventional way. When I called, they did help and I was able to buy my license the way I wanted to. If you are in the States, they have an office in Chicago. I am not in the States but that's the nearest office to where I live and the office I called. I think for Europe, look for an office in Germany.<br>

				<div class="content">Thank you for your suggestions, bo.elam. But that sounds like a lot of trouble. It's not like I want a license that badly, it's just that I would buy one if it were possible with bitcoin, as I don't use paypal and I only ever use my CC online if absolutely necessary.</div>
