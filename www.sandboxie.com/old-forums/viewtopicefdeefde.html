				<div class="content">Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask this, but I'm considering upgrading to 4.10 RC. I've only ever installed stable final release versions before, though. Additionally, I am a legacy lifetime user, and I run multiple sandboxes, some of which retain data I don't wish to lose.<br>
<br>
Will the RC recognize a legacy license? Do I need to take any additional steps beyond installing over the current installation? I don't wish to lose my sandbox settings, nor the data within the sandboxes. <br>
<br>
Again, sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this question.</div>

				<div class="content">Tetranitro, I can answer some of your questions. The RC recognizes your license. And you can run the installer over the top. If you choose "Overwrite", your settings are maintained. So you know, I use many sandboxes in my XP and W7, all programs and files that I run sandboxed are running great under 4.10 RC.<br>
<br>
Since I never keep anything installed in a sandbox for more than a few hours and have never upgraded SBIE while having a program installed in a sandbox, I can not tell you if "data within the sandboxes" is saved when you upgrade your Sandboxie, perhaps someone who keeps programs installed in sandbooxes can tell us how that goes.<br>

Maybe it was a temporal problem. I can download SandboxieInstall-410.exe.</div>
