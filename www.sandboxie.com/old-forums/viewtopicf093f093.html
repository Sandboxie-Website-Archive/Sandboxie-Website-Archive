Checked its compatibility with MBAE, still not injecting it dll., maybe the next updates will tackle compatibility issues with other software...</div>

MBAE compatibility has to be done by the MBAE folks.  It has been that way with every program I've had that had to work with Sandboxie.  If Hitman can do it Malwarebytes should also be albe to.  They just need to make the effort.<br>

I'm still getting these errors in both version 4.15.11 and 4.15.12 under Win8.1 64bit:<br>

<br>
These errors occur when I close the gamelauncher of Lord of the Rings Online, but they also occur randomly when the gamelauncher stays open. And in that case it crashes.<br>
<br>
They did not happen with any of the previous versions.</div>

				<div class="content">Discovered error which has existed in older versions that still exist in the beta 4.15.12<br>
<br>
Age of Empires II HD though Steam (I am not sure if this is a problem with the non steam version or not.)<br>
<br>
When launching AOE II HD in Steam (also in sandboxie) it shows the launcher/news window and then when play is pressed opens the main application.<br>
the problem happens when trying to create either a multiplayer quick match or solo standard game. Other game types such as campaign and the map building and tester work with out fault.<br>
<br>
once the user tries to start a quick match or standard game the program crashes with not warning or explanation. works fine out side of sandboxie<br>
<br>
If this could be fixed in the next build it would be very appreciated.</div>
