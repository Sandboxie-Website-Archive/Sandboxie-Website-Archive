				<div class="content">I haven't even installed the program yet (I'm trying to get as familiar as I can first), but I've been reading through the forum and the FAQs and the tutorials in order to get a working familiarity with Sandboxie. I was struck by the detailed and helpful support that is being offered by its author. I've never used a program of this complexity before, but hopefully once I do, I'll be able to hit the ground running and have a good experience. At the very least, I know that the author is right there doing everything possible to insure that things go well, and is up front about issues that remain to be fixed. Thanks for providing a much needed layer in computer security.</div>
