				<h3>Two Years Review</h3>

				<div class="content">A little over two years since my first review, let me just say.. if you are thinking about grabbing this app, do it!<br>
<br>
I started with the free demo.. just to test it out, get a feel for it. Since that day, this has become the most important piece of software I have ever owned. Well... besides the actual OS I mean.<br>
<br>
With Sandboxie, installing and re-installing the Windows OS is no longer necessary. The registry never gets dirty, and the PC never gets slow. I just install every app in sandboxie, and then delete the sandbox later.<br>
<br>
Any questions? Feel free to ask me here. I'm glad to help.<br>
<br>
PS.<br>
<br>
Check out the licensing agreement, tzuk has been <strong>very</strong> flexible and generous to allow you fair use with multiple PCs. Tzuk is unique in this respect because no other software vendor has been this flexible and generous. Its for this reason I hope he is rewarded for the efforts. Also Tzuk is super active with updates and compatibility requests.. just check the forum to see yourself. <br>
<br>
Cheers.</div>
