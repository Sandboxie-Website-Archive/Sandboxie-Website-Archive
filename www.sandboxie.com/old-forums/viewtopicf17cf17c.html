				<div class="content">Hello vgishmasters ,<br>
<br>
The latest officially supported Windows 10 build is Creator's Update.<br>
<br>
The devs are working on providing full support for the Fall's update, but have not yet released a build for it.  [The latest beta "should" work with it, however you will encounter problems such as crashes when right-clicking inside Windows Explorer, among other things].<br>
<br>
Information and new builds will be posted as soon as they become available.<br>
<br>

				<div class="content">Why do (specifically security companies like SB) wait until the literal last second, like in situations like this, it's not like MS out of no where dropped this release on us out of nowhere, do devs just not bother checking out the many many insider build of the up in coming OS, especially when it's getting very close to a official release.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Special ,<br>
<br>
We test Fast Ring releases to see what's new and what may have broke. However, Fast Ring builds are usually unstable and present issues that are OS related, so it is hard to tell sometimes what's a Sandboxie issue and what's just a build issue. We unfortunately have to wait for the last builds (the ones that are release candidates) in order to properly test/troubleshoot/fix possible bugs.<br>
On top of that, If the changes are too extensive, it can take a long time to find a way to fix them.  <br>
<br>
I hope that clarifies how this process works (at least from our end ). <br>
<br>
We have created a dedicated windows 10 Fall's update thread explaining what's still not working, please have a look:<br>

				<div class="content">Thanks for clarifying, It's just this is so common nowadays and gets pretty frustrating, with fast/slow/weeks of RC's, all the way up to release day it's hard to image these things slipping. But I can't blame you if you do check them and things just take time to figure out.<br>
<br>
Also I saw that "list of problems" and the Explorer freeze for 5 minutes has me worried, can you clarify on that, because I'm going to have to uninstall SB because I can't work around no right clicking on explorer windows. Does that mean if SB is running clicking any Explorer window is going to cause a freeze, or does that just mean for a sandboxed explorer window (one with a yellow boarder around it).<br>
<br>
Can I still use Windows native Explorer Window and navigate Sandboxie contents like D:\Sandbox\Downlaods &gt; cut/paste?</div>

Issue only happens inside a Sandboxed Windows Explorer. For further questions, please refer to the Windows 10 Fall's update thread.<br>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
When will the final version release for this new update? Please make it compatible with the latest version 1709 of Windows 10 x64 fall Creators Update. This new Windows 10 version is awesome and it works so wonderful. Yes, the first release of Windows 10 is buggy as hell but now they had fixed all the bugs and making major improvements on it. I don't know why there are people still clinging to Windows 7 or 8...lol. The new Windows 10 is fastest and has so many new features. Moving forward people. <br>
