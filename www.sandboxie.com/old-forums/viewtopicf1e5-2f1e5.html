				<div class="content">actually i just noticed something, a while ago 1 of my buddies tried installing FRAPS onto his computer and it was doing the same thing as the installer your referring to, he would start it and the setup would open for a second and then just immediatley termintate itself, other times he would try to start it and it just plain old wouldnt even open, now one of the things the fraps setup does is when you open the setup, it displays a splash screen for like 2 seconds, then proceeds to the setup, maybe that was the problem (somehow......), now i dont think he ever got it fixed (unless he re-formatted or something), but he was using Windows XPPro SP2, not vista, so i dont think it is a OS dependant problem, it must be something installed on your pc conflicting with SB or something, have you tried running a trace? that might pinpoint the problem? also just to see if it does it to you, try installing FRAPS and see if it does what this installer is doing to you, <a href="http://www.fraps.com/" class="postlink">http://www.fraps.com/</a> if so then tzuk would have 2 installers that are producing the same problem to analyze and might be able to fix the problem.</div>

				<div class="content">The problem is Vista specific, and has to do with launching programs from sandboxed folders, in Vista.<br>
<br>
Mark -- if you look carefully you'll see that the Setup.exe program is just a shell, a wrapper -- it extracts some program (which would be created in a sandboxed folder) and then runs it.<br>
<br>
There is/was a generic problem with Sandboxie handling this.  Now, I fixed about 90% of this problem -- you will see the Setup runs, but in the end when it's supposed to invoke the program itself, that part still doesn't work -- that's the missing 10%.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the program is actually installed and you can launch it from the Start Menu, so I'm going to leave the last 10% for a later update.</div>
