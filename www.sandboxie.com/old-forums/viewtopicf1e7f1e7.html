				<div class="content">Hey,<br>
right now Minecraft (1.6 dev, the latest snapshot gotten from mojang.com, but every other version of MC has the same issue.) behaves as if the mouse was my graphic tablet. That is, the view flips out when I try to look around, spinning like crazy at the slightest movement (Treating relative mouse positioning like absolute or vice versa? Not sure what the term there is.)<br>
<br>
This was not the case with 3.x of Sandboxie. Outside of the sandbox this works without issue as well.<br>
<br>
Disabling Wacom Tablet compatibility globally and for this sandbox specifically does not help either. <br>
No, I will not unplug my tablet.<br>
Deleting and recreating the sandbox does not fix this either.</div>

				<div class="content">You seem to imply that if you turn off the tablet, the problem does not occur.  If that's the case then I'm afraid I won't be able to do much about this problem because I don't have the necessary hardware.</div>

				<div class="content">I just checked, and no, even if I unplug the tablet <em>and</em> turn off the tablet driver service this issue still occurs. (That is, the mouse-look flipping out.)<br>

...wow, a 10 minute delay between making posts? o_O</div>

				<div class="content">OK.  In that case I'll make a note to look into this, although that won't happen before I release the official version 4.<br>
<br>
Can you tell me where I download version 1.6 dev of Minecraft and if I need some kind of game account to test the problem?</div>

				<div class="content"><a href="https://mojang.com/" class="postlink">https://mojang.com/</a>  &lt;- here you can get the latest dev snapshot<br>
<br>
I think you <em>might</em> be able to play the demo <a href="https://minecraft.net/demo" class="postlink">here</a>, but you need a (free for the demo) account in any case.<br>
Not sure if you can use the regular client with a demo account, but since both are java-based it should work.</div>

				<div class="content">Please check if version 4.03.01 makes a difference. Note that you will need to enable a window access setting. Please see: <br>

				<div class="content">Confirmed, adding a * to Window Access in .03 does fix this issue.<br>
<br>
<br>
(But there does seem to be a different access issue now... gotta investigate more.)</div>
