				<h3>Cannot make Internet Shortcuts by dragging web links</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Tue May 02, 2017 12:46 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>TimW</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I cannot drag web links (or the View Site Information icon in the address bar) from my browser to my desktop in order to create internet shortcuts to webpages.  This problem applies to both sandboxed Chrome and Firefox.<br>
<br>
This problem is not present with un-sandboxed browsers.<br>
(I realize that I could use DeskCut for Firefox, which works nicely, even sandboxed.  For Chrome there are also are menu-based methods which work, but these are not as convenient as the drag and drop method.)<br>
<br>
Conditions:<br>
- my sandbox is set for Direct Access to my desktop.<br>
- browsers are sandboxed, but are not installed in a sandbox.<br>
- using Windows 10, x64<br>
- Chrome Version 58.0.3029.81 (64-bit) -up to date<br>
- Firefox Version 53.0 (64-bit) -up to date<br>
- AVG Internet Security<br>
- Sandboxie Version 5.14 (64-bit)<br>
<br>
- Thanks for any help</div>

				<div class="content">Hello TimW,<br>
<br>
Drag-drop from the Sandbox to the Desktop does not work. However, you can open Windows Explorer Sandboxed and drag your files there.<br>
Right-click on your Sandbox--&gt; Run Windows Explorer <br>
Navigate to your Desktop <br>
Drag the urls from your Sandboxed browser to the Sandboxed Desktop.<br>
Since you have direct access, they will show up on your host's desktop as well.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>

<br>
Sandboxed links dragged out don't work.<br>
<br>
You can, however, drag or otherwise create one on the desktop outside of the sandbox then wrap a sandbox around them like any other link you want to run sandboxed. I do that with a couple of sites that are a little iffy but I want direct access from the desktop.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks Barb. I appreciate your help and your suggestion does work.  Still, please let me know if there is an alternative method that does not require keeping an opened, and not-minimized, sandboxed File Explorer window open.  Perhaps some kind of icon on the desktop could work?</div>

				<div class="content">TimW, you can create the shortcut unsandboxed and place it in the Desktop, then convert it sandboxed via:<br>
<br>
Configure&gt;Windows shell integration, select the sandbox, and in the Desktop menu find the link and click it.<br>
<br>
And leave the sandboxed icon in the Desktop.<br>
