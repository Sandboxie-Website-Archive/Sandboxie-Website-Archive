Like buster I always wondered what the implications could be but my searches never turned up much aside from programmers facing issues that didn't seem related. The shatter attack page might help as well but I haven't glanced over it yet. The ms link will take some time for me to sort through since I'm no programmer and quite a bit of it is greek to me. Either way thanks for sharing the links, at least I have a place to start finally!</div>

Do you know what the OpenWinClass=# would do in terms of lessening Sandboxie's security compared to OpenWinClass=*? I'll try with the # instead of * when I get the tablet back in my hands again and see if it works.<br>
<br>
Can you think of any other workaround to make Sandboxie work properly on a 32-bit Windows 8.1 tablet computer? I'd like to have as much security when browsing the web with a sandboxed Firefox as I have on my regular laptop (working without a problem, 64-bit Windows 7).<br>
<br>
Thank you for the help!</div></blockquote>

I finally got the tablet back and tried disabling the OpenWinClass=* and enabling the OpenWinClass=# feature and I got errors again when starting up Firefox and Firefox didn't work. So I switched back to OpenWinClass=*. Is there any other (safer) workaround for using Sandboxie on a tablet PC?<br>

You can run the resource access monitor and take note of which window classes are being blocked.  That might tell you which classes you need to open.</div>

				<div class="content">Bellzemos, using OpenWinClass=* in Windows XP is risky. For Windows Vista and above, the UIPI, UAC and the Untrusted Integrity Level(Lowest Level) of sandboxed application should prevent shatter attacks but that depends on how sandboxie handle application with manifest entry  UIAccess="true" and passed UIPI requirements. If sandboxie removed this entry then shatter and shatter like attacks will be prevented while using OpenWinClass=*. Although without it being removed the risk is very low because malware will unlikely pass the requirements but still possible.</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you very much for the explanation. I always disable the UAC and run Windows in admin mode. But I use the drop rights feature in the sandbox so that deals with that. Would a Windows 8.1 tablet with "OpenWinClass=*" still be relatively safe by having UAC disabled then? I don't have my tablet at hand at the moment, to run the Resource Access Monitor and am also too busy at the moment but I really think that a safer solution should be presented, to enable usage of Sandboxie on Windows tablets.</div>

				<div class="content">I did a second look on this and I realized that it will not pass one of UIPI requirements which is the application should be in Program Files directory/sub-directories or Windows directory/sub-directories. At first, I thought it will when an application is installed in a sandboxed in C:\Program Files directory. The application running in the sandboxed can see that it was running in this location but I forgot that the Windows is seeing differently, it sees the real location which cause it to fail in UIPI requirements.<br>
<br>
Disabling UAC is not recommended, it's another layer of defense.</div>

I know what you mean about the UAC but I've made this decision 5 years ago, I can't stand UAC and I have never ever had any problems so I'm sticking with it disabled.</div>

				<div class="content">Bellzemos, quoting tzuk post.
<blockquote><div><cite>tzuk wrote:</cite>The process in the sandbox is still running at untrusted integrity level even when OpenWinClass=* so the UAC/UIPI mechanism prevents it from accessing window objects that have a higher integrity level. And most window objects outside the sandbox should have at least medium integrity level.<br>
<br>
This means that on systems where UAC is enabled, OpenWinClass=* doesn't really mean the process in the sandbox has more access to window objects. However it can "see" and "read" window objects outside the sandbox directly without going through SbieSvc. Whereas without OpenWinClass=*, it cannot see or read window objects outside the sandbox directly, and has to go through the SbieSvc helper process.<br>
<br>
If UAC is disabled, and on Windows XP, integrity levels don't come into play for window objects, and OpenWinClass=* does give the process in the sandbox full access to window objects outside the sandbox.</div></blockquote></div>

				<div class="content">Thank you for the quote, I don't believe I've read it before. It really clarifies my question. So having the Drop Rights feature enabled in the sandbox with the "OpenWinClass=*" is not enogh then, right? I should re-enable the UAC on the tablet computer then?
