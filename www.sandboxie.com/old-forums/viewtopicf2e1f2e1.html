				<div class="content">hi<br>
i have some confusion regarding 1 year license term.<br>
does it mean my software will expire after 1 year and  i have to buy new license to run full version?<br>
or does it mean i am not eligible to have new updates after 1 year? ( so that mean i still have full version on the older version)??<br>
your answer please?<br>
thank you.</div>

				<div class="content">No, that was not accurate.  Prorgams features that are only available in the paid version (like forced programs) will not be available after the license expires.  Updates are always available, license or no license.</div>
