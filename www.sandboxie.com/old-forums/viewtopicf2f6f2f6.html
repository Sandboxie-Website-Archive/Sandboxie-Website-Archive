				<div class="content">Hello snow,<br>
<br>
I am currently running Origin on Windows 10x64, Sandboxed, and it shows under Nvidia GPU activity. <br>
Same for sandboxed Steam games.  I am using a Lenovo Laptop with Intel + Nvidia cards. <br>
<br>
Can you please provide more information regarding your issue?  What's your OS, SBIE and AV version?<br>
What is the exact problem you are encountering? <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>

Does this mean it is working now? <br>
5.14 was having issues with DirectX which were solved on version 5.16<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>choosing "Run with graphics processor" from context menu does not make any changes to app</div></blockquote>
So, when you open a Sandboxed Explorer and select to run a program with X graphic processor (either Intel or Nvidia), it opens with the incorrect one (or default)?<br>
Does it work fine outside Sbie? <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>

				<div class="content">Because you say you run Steam sandboxed. Can we get a preset for Steam?<br>
Because I got heavily issues when trying to put steam/steam games into Sandbox. Most of them won't launch correctly.<br>
<br>
I haven't reported or said anything because in other threads there was always the short answer: "Sandboxie is not designed for that purpose". But since you use it yourself for that and you said you don'T have issues... I would appreciate a preset like for all other applications existing in Sandboxie (even a SteamVR preset exist yet).</div>
