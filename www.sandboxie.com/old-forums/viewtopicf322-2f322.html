				<h3>Indexing in Outlook 2013 (Click-to-Run)</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sat Oct 28, 2017 5:00 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">When running sandboxed, Outlook does not seem to update my index of messages when I get new messages or move them to different folders.  Maybe I just noticed this, or maybe something has changed.  I'm running Outlook 2013 offline (all e-mail accounts are POP3) from a click-to-run installation of Office under Windows 7 SP1 and Sandboxie 5.20 64-bit.<br>
<br>
Example:  I just forced Windows to rebuild its index, which includes both Outlook itself (for my user) and the directory where the Outlook data file (.PST) resides.  When Outlook was then opened <em>inside </em>the sandbox, search could not find <em>anything at all</em>!  When I opened Outlook <em>outside </em>the sandbox and searched, however, it said it was indexing and did start to find things for me.  Now that Outlook's indexing appears to have completed, if I close it and then re-open <em>inside </em>the sandbox, search appears to work properly.<br>
<br>
Although I'm delighted that it is now possible to run click-to-run Office applications sandboxed, I'm wondering if I need to permit sandboxed Outlook to make changes to the Windows index that lives somewhere <em>outside </em>the sandbox.  Or is there some other problem at work here?</div>

				<div class="content">Hello jclarkw,<br>
<br>
There are several threads about Outlook indexing. Maybe they'll help:<br>
<a href="search356b356b.html?keywords=indexing+outlook" class="postlink">search.php?keywords=indexing+outlook</a><br>
<br>
I couldn't start an indexing rebuild inside Sandboxed Outlook (Win 7 x64 + Outlook 2016).  For the time being, you will have to do the indexing outside Sandboxie, as many of the threads listed before state that indexing does not work.<br>
 <br>
I'll reach out to the devs and let you know if they have any updates.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Barb.-</div>
