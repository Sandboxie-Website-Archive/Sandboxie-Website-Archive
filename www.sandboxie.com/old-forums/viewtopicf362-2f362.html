				<div class="content">Nested Sandboxes would be sometimes usefull.<br>
<br>
I use Sandboxie for 2 purposes :<br>
- Testing some softwares promptly<br>
- Working on some projects  limited in time<br>
<br>
For this 2nd usage, it would be cool to be able to test a software, or a different configuration in a lower-level sandbox without modifying the 1st one. For now, I do a copy of the sandbox folder before making my changes, and then I revert to this copy when I'm finished with my tests.<br>
<br>
And the top would be to be able to merge or not the 2 sandboxies at the end of the tests.</div>

				<div class="content">That sounds like merging snapshots or 2 instances of virtual environements on the fly. I believe that was mentioned as a commonly requested feature that won't be implemented. Check the sticky in this subforum.</div>

My feature request was principally about the nested sandboxes. The merging feature would be an extension of this. But you're right : this part is very close from what had been discussed in the Common Features Requests and had been rejected. So I remove this part of the proposal.</div>
