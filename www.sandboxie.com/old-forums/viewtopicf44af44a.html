Only telling you the way it is.<br>
<br>
Even though this is a beta, denying it is breaking Flash when it clearly is in FF is not too sensible. It wasn't broken in .4 so one assumes you should be able to trace the changes.</div>

Installed the latest beta 4.13.6, been using SRware Iron and Palemoon browsers. I don't experience any problem regarding Iron, but in the case of Palemoon this comes up by just going to Youtube. Flash 15 Plugin is installed think this is a version for chrome, but this error doesn't show in 4.13.4 and I can watch videos in both browsers w/ no problem except the occasional GUI_proxy something in Iron.<br>

				<div class="content">Bug reports for the 4.13.6. All of these are tested on Windows 7 x64 SP1<br>
<br>
<strong>- Firefox 32.0.3 with Flash 15</strong><br>
<br>
Firefox hangs/freeze/locks up when Flash is being used on a page (see any Youtube video with Flash for example). This also happen in 4.13.5 but there's no problem in 4.13.4.<br>
<br>
<em>Workaround:</em> Disabling Flash ProtectedMode works but i believe this is not the proper way to do it*.<br>
<br>
<strong>- Chrome 64-bit Stable and Dev (38.0.2125.101 m (64-bit) and 40):</strong><br>
<br>
1. When running chrome this message appear:<br>
<br>
SBIE2303 Could not hook SetSecurityInfo (1)<br>
SBIE2318 DLL initialization failed for 'ntmarta.dll'<br>
<br>
This does not happen on chrome 32-bit stable and dev. Also this does not happen on 4.13.5 for both 32 and 64-bit chrome.<br>
<br>
2. Hardware acceleration still not available<br>
<br>
The easiest way to test whether Hardware Acceleration is enabled and running please visit this page <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/performance/fishbowl/" class="postlink">http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/performance/fishbowl/</a> .<br>
<br>
As you can see the FPS is really low because hardware acceleration is not running. Try running that page in another browser (tested on FX32,IE11 and also chrome with workaround) and you'll see big difference in FPS.<br>
<br>
<em>Workaround:</em> Use chrome parameter to disable chrome sandbox feature when running chrome, but i believe this is also not the proper way to do it*.<br>
<br>
* Because if there's an exploit for chrome/flash it'll cause problem in that sandbox which is bad if each sandbox container is being used for portability/portable use (i.e sandbox is not deleted after each use).</div>

Working well now for me on Windows 8.1.1 x64 with Chome 38 64-bit. Thanks. On windows 7 x64, I see the same reported error messages. However, hardware acceleration hits 60 for me using Chrome 38 or IE 11.</div>

You can ignore this error.  It will be fixed in 4.13.7.</div>

The problem with Flash standalone is not being denied, but has been fixed in 4.13.7.  As a side note, it looks like the Flash standalone is on its way to deprecation (replaced by Flash add-ons).</div>
