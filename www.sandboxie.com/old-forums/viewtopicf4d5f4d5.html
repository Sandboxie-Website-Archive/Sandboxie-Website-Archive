lwc, like you, I prefer not to hide messages but I think in this particular case is OK to do it since it is a extremely  rare message, you are still able to do what you want and you would only be hiding the message in "one" sandbox. I think, I would hide it if I was experiencing the same situation.<img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>

				<div class="content">Is easy to test to see that if you hide a  message, its only hidden in the particular sandbox that you are using when you clicked Hide.<br>
<br>
For testing, hide SBIE message 1308 in one sandbox and you ll see that you still get the message  in other sandboxes when a program that's not allowed to run attempts to Start and Run.<br>

It should hide the message for the specific detail shown in the message, i.e. *GUIPROXY_00000000 - MSOSYNC.EXE [FF000005].<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>bo.elam wrote:</cite>Is easy to test to see that if you hide a message, its only hidden in the particular sandbox that you are using when you clicked Hide.</div></blockquote>

Some messages have the sandbox name in the detail, so that effectively hides the message for a particular sandbox.</div>

				<div class="content">Just an FYI the problem occurs after restoring my group policy settings from a backup, evidently they were the cause. Simply resetting to defaults is enough to fix the problem and it is easily reproduced.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

				<div class="content">I am not sure this can explain it.<br>
I haven't made any changes to group policy settings on my test systems,<br>
so I should have the default group policy.<br>
Why don't I see this problem?</div>

				<div class="content">I think he means that he had none-default settings and that was the cause, not default settings as you do (which is why you wouldn't have the error).</div>
