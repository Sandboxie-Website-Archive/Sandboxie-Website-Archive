				<div class="content">In both, IE8 (XP SP3 32Bits) and IE9 (W7 SP1 32Bits) I have a rough time opening links in new tabs or new windows. I don't know if it happened on previous betas as I don't use IE much but it should be easy for you to reproduce (I think).<br>
<br>
The problem: When I click on a link to open in a new tab or new window, the link doesn't open, IE freezes for a few seconds and then it unfreezes but the new link or new page doesn't open. It doesn't happen every time I click on a link but it happens real quick if I am trying to produce the problem. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>

And just to clarify, the link you are clicking to open, that link is itself within the same IE browser program, correct?<br>
In other words:  The problem does not involve any programs other than IE.</div>

				<div class="content">Opera is my default browser on XP. Am using Sbie 4.0.0.6<br>
<br>
When I open it up using sbie desktop default browser icon, it goes to my default home page which is about:blank.<br>
<br>
The first page I select to open from my favourites freezes for about 10 seconds before opening, other tabs open okay after that.<br>
<br>
If I right click on IE desktop icon and select run sandboxed I do not get this behavior. (remember IE is not my default)</div>

Noticed when I fired up Opera to check version (sandboxed) I had the same delay in trying to access the Opera menu to get the help..about Opera.</div>

Yes, the problem does not involve any other program but Internet Explorer. I can replicate the issue in this site or any site using IE. For example, in this site,  clicking in Forum, Download, Search, etc, can bring the issue after a minute. For me, it is easier and can reproduce the problem faster by right clicking on links but it also happens when I left click on them.<br>
<br>
The first time I noticed this problem was after posting on another site a link to the announcement of V4.01.06 being released. After I made that post, I left clicked on the link to the SBIE announcement to make sure it was working,  that's  when I noticed that the link did not open and IE became frozen for a few seconds.<br>

				<div class="content">Tzuk, I just went about 15 minutes without any page freezing, only left clicking on links. But as soon as I clicked on the link in post #124, IE9 became frozen. Perhaps, the situation that I have described affects  links when they are from sites other than the one where the link is located at. Afterward, IE9 also froze when I left clicked on a Youtube link posted in a non Youtube page. HTH.<br>

Bo/Tzuk, <br>
<br>
I can confirm that this seems to be a definite IE-related bug.  I have been experiencing these issues on both of my W7-x64 PCs, one running IE9 and the other IE10.</div>

<br>
However I'm unable to reproduce the delays with Opera.<br>
<br>
Maybe due to some conflict with other software?  Can you post a resource log opera?</div>

I switched to another snapshot and re-installed Opera. Issue with Opera gone now  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>

Glad to hear you may have fixed the issue with IE.</div>
