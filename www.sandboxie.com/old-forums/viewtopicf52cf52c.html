				<h3>Security Alert Feature for Opening/Extracting Programs</h3>

				<div class="content">A good idea would be an option to have Sandboxie issue an alert when one attempts to open or extract a program that is contained within the sandbox.<br>
<br>
Even better, would be Sandboxie's ability to prevent the contents from being opened or extracted.<br>
<br>
Yes, the whole concept of Sandboxie is to isolate particular and possibly malicious programs but security would be hardened if these features could be implemented.<br>
<br>
In other words, if one likes exploring the contents of the sandbox, and attempts to open or extract a program i.e. zip file contained within it, one could be exposing oneself to possible security issues.<br>
<br>
A person needs to know as a rule, that they should not open or attempt to extract an isolated program outside of the sandbox unless they know it comes from a trusted source but I think "knowing" and "remembering" is not enough and reminders would be a great help and enhance the security provided by Sandboxie even more.<br>
<br>
Thanks tzuk for a fantastic program <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

Alerts might be OK if they can be turned off as an option, but restricting access would severely limit the way I and other experienced users use SandboxIE.<br>
<br>
For example, I often install programs in a sandbox and then extract selected files to create portable versions.<br>

I agree with you, providing an enable/disable option for the user to receive alerts and/or disable executable programs contained within a sandbox would satisfy all needs.</div>

				<div class="content">I have no problem with alerting against -- or even completely restricting -- sandboxed file activation from outside of the sandbox. I think that's a very good idea.<br>

Otoh, simple file operations (move, copy, delete) should, in my opinion, <em>not</em> be restricted.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Optional</span> alerts (if any) for these type operations would be my preference as well.<br>

<br>
I agree with both of you, a configuration as you have described would definitely work for me. <br>
<br>
Thank you both for your inputs:).</div>
