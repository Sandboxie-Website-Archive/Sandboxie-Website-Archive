				<h3>Opera strange Problems</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Mon Jun 24, 2013 5:10 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Shinigami</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Hi Sandboxie Community,<br>
<br>
I have since the v4.02 strange Problems with my Browser Opera in Sandboxie.<br>
<br>
I`m using Windows 7 64bit Pro <br>
<br>
First Problem:<br>
With this Version it opens Opera in a new instance:  <img src="../s15.postimg.org/j8twyenbb/klick1.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image">  <img src="../s12.postimg.org/65kx5dmyx/klick2.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
This is not that grave but still irritating.<br>
<br>
The bigger Problem is:<br>
If Opera is already open in Sandboxie and I click on a external link like from Teamspeak or Word Document it looks like that: <a href="http://postimg.org/image/ocadyyytv/" class="postlink"><img src="../s13.postimg.org/ocadyyytv/strange.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></a><br>
<br>
I had no one of this Problems in the previous Version. Hope u can fix it soon.<br>
<br>
Sincere regards and sorry for my bad english <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

				<h3>Strange problem with 4.02</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Tue Jun 25, 2013 3:59 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>djg05</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I am using Windows 8/64 Pro.<br>
<br>
I thought I had some sort of virus and have spent ages tracking it down. Eventually it turns out that it only occurs when I install ver 4.02. <br>
<br>
This problem happens when I click on a link in my email client (The Bat) which is not run sandboxed. It happens whether or not the computer is plugged into the internet, and will also happen when I click on a link in Outpost f/w to connect to their site.<br>
<br>
I deleted the content of the sandbox before trying.<br>
<br>
The only other security at the time was Avast. The browser is Opera (default)<br>
<br>
I am enclosing a screenshot of the problem. It seems to be trying to search some chinese location.<br>
<br>
For the time being I am using ver 3.76 which is not affected<br>
<br>
It appears I cannot upload an image.</div>

				<div class="content">I can confirm this problem - very strange. All external links, if opera is the standard browser open a google page with Asian typos in the searchbox? Here is some already complaining about that issue but no reply so far<br>
<a href="../phpbb/viewtopic0633.php?t=15822&amp;highlight=external+link+opera" class="postlink">http://www.sandboxie.com/phpbb/viewtopi ... link+opera</a><br>
<br>
I am using Windows 8/64 Pro too, but had this problem also with windows 7 x64 and v4.02<br>
<br>
This is at some point very disappointing, using a software to be more secure which behaves that strange an no one reacts on this issue. <br>
<br>

				<h3>[4.03.03] IPC Problem</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Tue Jul 02, 2013 10:01 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>nph</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
first of all, thanks for the great sw!<br>
<br>
I have a problem with IPC in the new versions (4.02 - 4.03.03)<br>
<br>
When I start Opera with an argument, like this:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>start.exe /box:default opera.exe google.com</code></pre></div>
it works perfectly for the first time. But if the process already exists, the second one finds the first one successfully, and then sends junk characters to it (instead of "google.com"). In fact, it sends them even without passing any argument to opera.exe.<br>
<br>
Opera 11.64:<br>

The key thing was as <strong>nph</strong> mentioned above -- must have an instance of Opera already running in the sandbox to see the problem.  Should have noticed this point earlier, I apologize.
