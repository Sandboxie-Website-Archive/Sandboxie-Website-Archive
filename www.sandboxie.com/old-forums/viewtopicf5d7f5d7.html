				<div class="content">Hi!<br>
<br>
Is it possible to recover a hole Sandbox? I think its a good idea to install a new (perhaps unknown) program in a separat Sandbox to make a test. If i like this program i would recover it from the sandbox. In this way a "reinstalltion" isn't necessary ...</div>

				<div class="content">I appreciate the thought, but the sandbox may (and almost certainly will) contain files and registry elements that aren't related to the program that you want to recover.<br>
<br>
Sandboxie would have no way to decide what contents actually makes up that particular program, and what content shouldn't be recovered out of the sandbox.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't know exactly how Sandboxie works, but why there are other elements that aren't related to the program i installed into a empty sandbox?<br>
<br>
If i make a sparately sandbox for each programm i want to install, sandboxie than has nothing to decide, because the user has than to decide what program he want to recover. In this way Sandboxie can recover all the content from the selectet Sandbox ... ?<br>

				<div class="content">Windows itself, as well any number of <em>other tools</em> you may have installed, can and will be creating files in the sandbox as part of normal operation.<br>
<br>
I could spend forever classifying all such possible files and keys, so that Sandboxie knows to ignore them when recovering.  Unfortunately, I don't have forever.<br>
<br>
So instead of me spending forever on this feature, you're going to have to spend a couple more minutes to re-install the useful program.</div>
