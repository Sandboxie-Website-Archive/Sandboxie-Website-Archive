				<div class="content"><strong>I find that in addition to Sandboxie being about as important as my AV and firewall programs for all my needs, it is also great in helping me control potentially dangerous spam mail! Since I cannot Sandbox my ISP,and my ISP is my main source for incoming e-mail, I initially had a problem since whenever I got e-mail with file attachments, on one hand I wanted to get the e-mail address they came from to block them, but on the other-hand, I was afraid to open them so I could get the e-mail addresses to do this.  Keep in mind that the only way I can view the incoming e-mail addressed is to actually open up my e-mail. I soon found that in opening another browser Sandboxed, and accessing my e-mail through that browser, I could open up ANY e-mail (including with file attachments), without fear. This enables me to get the e-mail address in case I want to add it to my block list.   Therefore, Sandboxie, in addition to all of the other ways it shields a machine, is great to prevent harm from dangerous e-mails-even with file attachments!  I am very grateful to Mr. TZur for this outstanding program!<br>
