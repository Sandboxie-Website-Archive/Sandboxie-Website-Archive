				<h3>[.02] Unable to paste images into some sandboxed programs</h3>

				<div class="content">Windows 7 32-bit<br>
Sandboxie v4.06<br>
AliIM 2013Beta2 (7.09.01M) (<a href="http://www.taobao.com/go/chn/ww/index.php?spm=0.0.0.0.O5iQlp" class="postlink">download website</a>, click blue button)<br>
<br>
(I am running all latest versions.)<br>
<br>
I recently started seen some problems with IM chat application "AliIM". Although you may never have heard of this program, it actually has a huge user base: it is the second most-used instant messaging software in mainland China after Tencent QQ, and it is used by every single Taobao (Chinese eBay) seller and buyer to communicate with each other.<br>
<br>
<strong>1)</strong> The problem is that, while I can paste text, I cannot paste images, such as screen captures, into AliIM since Sandboxie v4.xx. After reverting to Sandboxie v3.76 I am able to paste images again.<br>
<br>
<strong>2)</strong> Another possibly related problem occurs when copying Chinese characters from inside AliIM. The clipboard viewer reveals that every Chinese character has been copied as a question mark. This problem happens with Sandboxie v3.76 too, so it could easily be a bug in AliIM.<br>
<br>
<strong>3)</strong> Probably unrelated, but when I launch AliIM I do get the following warning, although I seem to get it just as well with v3.76:<br>

<br>
I have just tested with Wordpad and had no problem pasting images. In addition, all other apps I regularly run in the same sandbox as AliIM don't exhibit this problem either, only AliIM does.</div>

				<div class="content">I think it might be difficult to look into this problem specifically in the context of AliIM because (a) it's Chinese language software, I imagine, and (b) I don't have an account in the service.  Perhaps you could still find some other program that shows the same problem?</div>

				<div class="content">Unfortunately I haven't found another app where this happens, but if you are happy to test, I have just created an account and added myself as a contact so that you are able to open a chat window, which is where screenshots are pasted. I have just PMed you screenshots showing basic operation of the software and login credentials, and a link to download the whole sandbox directory where the software is pre-installed, as well as sandboxie.ini.<br>
<br>
The file you need to run is this: <strong>C:\Sandbox\Manuel\DefaultBox\drive\C\Program Files\AliWangWang\AliIM.exe</strong><br>
<br>
You will get logged in automatically as I've set the app to remember the login credentials. Thank you!</div>

				<div class="content">I just tried to PM you but every time I click "Return to Inbox" I get a warning message telling me to wait before sending another PM, so I think there's a bug in the forum, so I am not sure the PM got sent. Consequently I am just going to post it here.<br>

Hi tzuk, this PM is regarding the issue I reported in <a href="../phpbb/viewtopic0f80.php?p=95454#95454" class="postlink">this thread</a>.<br>

Just tested version 4.07.05 and I am able to copy/paste images into and from AliIM. Thank you Tzuk!<br>
<br>
Did you find any oddities regarding issue <strong>2)</strong> in this thread's opening post, whereby Asian script characters (Chinese in this case) are incorrectly copied out of AliIM and shown as question marks in the clipboard viewer? Looks like a character encoding issue, and it's not necessarily an SB bug. I will check on a friend's computer where AliIM is run un-sandboxed on an English version of Windows 7, will post back my findings.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for this update(s), they are really useful <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

Added support for pasting bitmaps and metafiles from the clipboard. </div></blockquote>
What a weird phrasing of this feature. Shouldn't it be "Improved" support instead of "Added"?<br>
<br>
Anyway, I wonder what was the specific issue regarding pasting into AliIM.</div>
