				<div class="content">Is it really necessary to have this irritating delay on the free Sandboxie version ?<br>
<br>
No other free programs do this and I see no logical reason why Sandboxie should do it. What does it achieve ? NOTHING ! Except to drive the user crazy.<br>
 <br>
It has no psychological impact whatsoever in persuading a user to invest in the "paid" version, in fact quite the opposite. It is a total stopper.</div>

I placed my question on the only Forum which is relevant to the issue, after all, that is what a Forum is all about - to raise issues.<br>
<br>
Thank you for copying my complimentary comments of November 2011, because I endorse every word I said and more. No user can be more appreciative of such a wonderful program than I can and to consider the "developer" as a genius.<br>
<br>
But that has no connection whatsoever to my OP.<br>
<br>
I have used countless free programs over time and still do, involving some of the biggest names on the web. They have all been excellent and all offer added advantages in their paid versions. It is standard marketing practice.<br>
<br>
The free Sandboxie version performs impeccably for me, but surely you are not suggesting that the benefits of the paid version simply amount to getting rid of this unique 4 second delay period in logging on ?<br>
<br>
""I want it all" but don't want to pay a dime for it". This is a rather extreme accusation to make and cannot be further from the truth. I do not "Want it all" for free, I just see no reason to have this delay period embedded into the free version when nobody else on the web adopts such a practice.<br>
<br>
I would honestly be satisfied if I knew the reason  for it, but cannot think of one.</div>

Peter, my grateful thanks for your kind and considerate comments, which I fully understand.<br>
I have that distinct feeling of walking into a Lions Den just before feeding time.<br>
<br>
Most likely your post is the best I can hope for and corroborates my own personal conclusion as to why this delay is imposed with the free version.<br>
<br>
No big sweat really Peter, 4 seconds is a small price to pay for such an excellent product and it only happens after computer shut-down. As I use Standby and Hibernate, then apart from an unexpected shut-down, the minimum time I see a delay panel is once every 24 hours, often longer.<br>
<br>
Thank you.</div>

Your extreme is being a thief.  The solution is simple.  Buy it.   Do you go into a book store and consider stealing a book because you feel the price is wrong.</div>

				<div class="content">The unnecessary Nag-screen being a time-theif *might* for some not-so-patient users become an illegit urge, why provoking? I mean that the primary/practical purpose of the Nag screen is just to remind the user he lacks some benefits/features, not irritating. That said, I can afford a few seconds while I cannot forget the version is -n-a-g-g-i-n-g- free.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, if Ronen doesn't like *free* opt then he should just reconsider the biz-conception, for example, as a shareware, not a nag-ware or alike. Actually, much is about target the audience, and most people are tolerable about a few seconds delays whereas some become frustrated even at the slightest lag or a hint.<br>
<br>
For instance, a friend of mine was disappointed his brand-new note under w8.1 reacted about 'half-a-second' slower than w7, so he demanded his refund because "the product was terribly lagging and horribly slow" (from his point of view). People differ, but I'm pretty sure there'd be a few "inpatients" who might consider speeding-up even via weirdly wrong ways; they are being forced to. You see, not everything is about money, unfortunately.<br>
<br>
Cheers.</div>

The ones that become frustrated because of the screen, ought to be be grateful instead. The free version is a gift. The right thing to do when you get a gift is to say "Thank you". Looking for faults in the free version or complaining about the screen is not proper.<br>

				<div class="content">All replies on this topic are perfectly legitimate and respected individual opinions and  every one of them expresses a  sensible point of view.<br>
<br>
In a nutshell, YES this nag panel is an amazing and unnecessary diversion from the procedure adopted by hundreds of other FREE programs, every one of which have paid versions, but do not see any reason to bombard their customers with a persistent pop-up nag panel to remind them.<br>
<br>
I would remind all of you that each one of your globally dominating browsers is FREE, followed by a multitude of AV`s, FW`s and a myriad of other vital programs which we all use daily. The web is full of them and almost every one has a monetary interest in promoting their paid versions.<br>
 <br>
Do we feel grateful for these "gifts" ? Of course we do, but we do not go into a remorseful frenzy for not saying "thanks" to this vast army of good Samaritans who make our Internet lives easier and safer.<br>
<br>
Having said that, I agree 100% that we FREE Sandboxie users must all feel eternally grateful to Tzuk for granting us the privilege of using his miraculous and astonishing program as a freebie.<br>
<br>
I myself am sincerely grateful and say a huge THANKS to Tzuk for being allowed use Sandboxie free. YES, the nag delay panel is an unnecessary nuisance, but if that is what Tzuk feels is needed to enhance his marketing aspirations, then 4 seconds is a very small price to pay for using the exclusive and unbelievable wonders of Sandboxie.</div>

My grateful thanks for your most intellectual and explicit reply. It has the panache of an untrained carthorse.<br>
<br>
I explained my opinion in a most dignified, polite and concessionary manner in my previous post. I would have thought that was sufficient.<br>
<br>
For your personal enlightenment, I have more money than I know what to do with, money is no object and like others including yourself, YES I do spend money on nonsense crap - part of the joys of life. But that is none of your business.<br>
<br>
What I do NOT do is place any of my financial details on this wonderful computer that we all play with and for the whole world to see. That way, I spend it, not some hacker in the Far East.<br>
<br>
Finally, I have some great news for you - the FREE version of Sandboxie is absolutely fantastic and works impeccably. So why did YOU buy it and criticise me for not ?<br>
<br>
Mis mejores deseos.<br>
Ahora te callas.<br>

Hi,<br>
You just think, reflect, re-think and SEE again over and over again the complain you're exposing, please.  Then you'll realize it's pointless... <br>
Nag screen?, then buy it.  Moreover you contribute to a better software production.<br>

I understand the psychology of your remarks, of course I do and I fully endorse your <br>
reasoning. Nevertheless, in a market where thousands of products have a free and paid version, the onus is on the vendor whether to offer a free version or not. <br>
<br>
You cannot blame the user for taking advantage of these generosities and for sticking with them if they are personally satisfactory, rather than paying for them. <br>
I have used countless free programs over the years and every one of them has been outstanding. <br>
<br>
I have never had a paid program on my computer and my current selection covers many dozens. <br>
<br>
I have met the "paid up" fraternity many times on Forums, casting the same disparaging remarks against freebie users and find it rather tiresome. <br>
<br>
Sinceramente te deseo lo mejor y espero que ahora podemos ser más constructivos en nuestra relación... <br>
