				<div class="content">Hi, I've been using sandboxie for last couple of months and found easy to use and very useful. While upgrading to Win10, I also bought the license but then during installation I had issues and then foudn out that it's not suppoirted on Win10 yet. My bad, I should've checked before I purchased the license. <br>
I've emailed support a couple of times with the reference nos etc, haven't had any response at all. What's my refund process here?</div>

Hello:<br>
Cleverbridge is the payment processor. You would need to contact them. <a href="https://www.cleverbridge.com/296/?scope=cuseco&amp;id=irpL7Uu2Vd&amp;progress=customersupportform&amp;cfg=default" class="postlink">https://www.cleverbridge.com/296/?scope ... fg=default</a><br>

 <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?:" title="Question"> Win10 hasn't been released as of yet (7/29) and SBIE v5.01 does support the latest build 10158. So I'm confused, why would you ask for a refund on a product that has not been released to the general public as of yet? <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?:" title="Question"></div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the reply, I haven't checked on teh latest build, I only tried 4.18 and had checked on the current build. Will run an update and report back. <br>
<br>
Refund was only if it didn't work on W10, however looking at the forum it does look positive <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>
<br>
Had emailed support and hadn't heard back until now (3 weeks now)  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?:" title="Question">  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":|" title="Neutral"> <br>
<br>
Obviously this forum's more active, will post my queries here.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>

Feel free to post here. I'll do my best to keep everyone informed about SBIE and Win10. I was told that the current build 10162 works w/ SBIE v5. However, Edge and Metro are still not supported.</div>
