				<div class="content">Using Sandboxie can I install 2 (or more) different software under the same sandbox?<br>
How do I do it?<br>
My objective is that those 2 programs change each other and they need one another to function.<br>
Thank you</div>

				<h3>Can I take a snapshot at a sandbox to act like a backup</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Thu Apr 18, 2013 10:21 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>dan_san_1</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Is it possible to install programs to single sandbox and then take a snapshot at that sandbox so that if I make some changes that I regret at that sandbox, I can restore it.<br>
In other words, can I make a backup of a sandbox so that I might be able to restore that sandbox later if I need? Kinda like making a restore point of a sandbox.<br>
How can I do it?<br>
Thanks</div>

				<div class="content">Create a new sandbox, right click the installers, choose to run them sandboxed in the new sandbox. Don't set the new sandbox to delete on closing. Run the programs you installed by right clicking on Sandboxie control, hover the mouse over the new sandbox and click on  Run from start menu. Find your program. It should work most of the time. Try it.<br>

				<div class="content">Yes, you can make a copy of the sandbox folder anytime you want to, and then copy it back to the same location so that it is restored to its original contents.<br>
You could zip the sandbox folder and its contents, and unzip them again if desired.</div>

Guest10 gave me the answer that I was looking for.<br>
If I create a sandbox (on C: ) with the name "Work" where would the sandbox folder be?<br>

				<h3>Program inside a sandbox, log files outside sandbox</h3>

				<div class="content">Can I make a program that "lives" inside a sandbox, log files to a folder that is outside of the sandbox?<br>
I would like the rule that gives permission to write data outside of the sandbox to be exclusively for that program. All other programs that "lives" inside that sandbox CANNOT do that.<br>

You can delete the sandbox when you want to. Take a look at Sandbox settings&gt;Delete. <br>

				<div class="content">Take a look at Sandbox settings&gt;Resource access&gt;File access&gt;Full access. In the "All programs window", select the program that you like to allow to write outside the sandbox. Use the "Add" button, to navigate and select the folder where you want sandboxing to be bypassed. I think, this should allow you to do what you want.<br>

				<div class="content">You also can limit which files a program can write outside of the sandbox, either by using an exact file name, or by using a wild card for the name and specifing an extension for the files.<br>
In this case, after you select the program.exe that will be allowed to save files out of the sandbox (in the Full Access setting) you would use the "Edit/Add" button to specify the exact file names (one at a time)  - or use a wild card for the name and list the file extension:<br>
Examples:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>program.log  (&lt;--only a file with this exact name can be written out of the sandbox by the program)
program.ini  (&lt;-- as above)
*.log        (&lt;-- any file with a .log extension)
*.ini        (&lt;--any file with a .ini extension)</code></pre></div></div>

				<h3>Program inside sandbox and database outside of sandox</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Fri Apr 19, 2013 11:12 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>dan_san_1</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I want to execute this program that stores and reads data from a Postgresql database.<br>
I have this program sandboxed. In order for it to function it needs to interact with the Postgresql database.<br>
I don't know if I am mistaken but I believe that ALL the interactions between apps and Postgresql's databases goes through a TCP/IP connection. Please tell me if I am wrong about this.<br>
My question is: in order for that program to function do I need to install the database inside of the sandbox or will it also work if I have the database outside of the sandbox (since all the interactions between app to database goes through tcp/ip)?</div>
