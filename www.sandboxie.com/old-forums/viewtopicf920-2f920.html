				<div class="content">I think this was mentioned recently. Seems like an esoteric feature outside of Sandboxie's scope. No driveby virus could install permanently on the system or modify anything via  mic/webcam, so it doesn't seem of any importance. Seems like a privacy feature, whereas Sandboxie is first and foremost a security app.<br>
<br>
 Another reason cited is that its very difficult if not impossible to be able to differentiate between legitimate and criminal access to these resources. If you want however, you could use blocked filepaths to the webcam software, thereby making it inaccessible to sandboxed programs.</div>

				<div class="content">The easy approach in my opinion is to open Device Manager, find the webcam device and right-click disable, whenever you want the webcam turned off, and use right-click Enable when you want it back on.  This of course applies both inside and outside the sandbox.<br>
<br>
The more difficult approach is to look in the Details tab of the device in Device Manager, in the Physical Device Object name property, and add the \Device\XXXXXXX resource that you see, in the Blocked File Access settings in Sandboxie.  This block would apply only in the sandbox.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if any of this applies to the microphone.</div>
