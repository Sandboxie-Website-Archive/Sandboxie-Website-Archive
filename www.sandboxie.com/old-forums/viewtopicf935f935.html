				<div class="content">Hello everybody.<br>
<br>
There is a strange issue with the forced folders settings. If you open a forced folder on a networkshare (i.e. \\fileserver\newfolder) directly in windows explorer, the settings work as intended. Only the programs/files opened in the folder start sandboxed. If you open it with %systemroot%\explorer.exe \\fileserver\newfolder the whole folder opens sandboxed. This didn't happen before. Unfortunately i can't recall what causes this behavior or since when. Closest is before the start of december 2017 and i'm pretty sure its caused by a windows update. Reasons are Sandboxie wasn't updatet since october 2017 and it doesn't happen on windows 7.<br>

<br>
I cannot reproduce this behavior with network shares nor with local drives. Can you please provide more information as well as a copy of your Sandboxie configuration file? <br>
(Configure--&gt; Edit configuration. Copy/paste the contents here , highlight them and click on the "&lt;/&gt;" button for formatting purposes). <br>
<br>
Are you able to reproduce this in a new Sandbox with default settings? (you will need to disable the force folder setting from the previous one). <br>
<br>

Sorry for the late response. Anyway here is the sandboxconfig. I had to remove the forcedfolder-paths due to company-restrictions. Same goes for usernames.<br>

<br>
edit: Now it happens with Windows 7 too. To be more specific about the exact problem: <br>
If you open the forced folder "normally" by double clicking it everything works as intended. If you open it with a .bat-file like :<br>
%systemroot%\eplorer.exe \\forcedfolderpath <br>
or by typing this line into cmd/windows explorer, the whole folder opens sandboxed.</div>

<br>
I re-tested using cmd and a bat file, I did not see the behavior you are seeing.<br>
<br>
I cannot analyze your logs without the forced folder information. Can you re-upload it with fake names /letters/ ip addresses ? I  really need to understand what kind of setup you are using since I cannot reproduce this behavior. Be sure to keep whatever relation is involved between the folders (if they have similar names, or belong in the same path, etc... ).<br>
<br>
Maybe you are invoking a folder that resides inside a forced folder ?<br>
Example:<br>
Force folder---&gt; \\yourpath\Folder1 <br>
Folder inside forced folder---&gt; \\yourpath\Folder1\Folder2 <br>
<br>
If you launch Folder1 it will not open Sandboxed, but if you invoke Folder2 via explorer/bat/cmd it wil open Sandboxed as it is inside Folder1 (which is forced). <br>
<br>

Excatly this is the case.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>If you launch Folder1 it will not open Sandboxed, but if you invoke Folder2 via explorer/bat/cmd it wil open Sandboxed as it is inside Folder1 (which is forced). </div></blockquote>

I'm sure it wasn't like this before (~until december 2017) and there wasn't a sandboxie update in this time. <br>
I used v5.22 the whole time and this changed "over night". So my prediction is, it changed because of an update for Windows. <br>
<br>
But if this is how the forced folders should behave now, like u say, then I'm really sorry for wasting your time.<br>

We do not push changes "overnight" to Sandboxie. Users will either receive a new release version, or manually download a beta from the beta section.  <br>
I am not seeing how this Force Folder behavior is an issue, there were changes made on beta 5.21.6 that improved the Forced Folder functionality:<br>

I know that. And thats why I wrote:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>So my prediction is, it changed because of an update for Windows.</code></pre></div>
I'm just curious what caused this change of behavior. I can confirm that it wasn't the case "before"(until december 2017) and i would appreciate to have the old functionality back.<br>
To explane this:<br>
<br>
We have a special email-attachment-solution at our company. If a user gets an email with attachment, the attachment is saved to a folder and the user recieves an email with a link to this folder. The link is %systemroot%\explorer.exe \\forcedfolder\%username% because every employee has its own personalised folder. All these personalised folders are within a forced folder.<br>
If the user opens the recieved file it opens sandboxed because it is inside a forced folder. But if he/she wants to copy&amp;paste, drag&amp;drop or attach the file to the email again, he/she could do it without restrictions caused by the sandbox because the folder didn't open sandboxed. So you had a safe way to open the file but could also process it conveniently. <br>
Now the whole folder opens sandboxed which causes trouble by processing files to unsandboxed programms or folders. Thats it. <br>
<br>

At this point, the feature is working as intended (after the changes I provided above were applied). <br>
However, I have made the devs aware of your request/situation. <br>
<br>
I'll update this thread if anything new comes up.<br>
