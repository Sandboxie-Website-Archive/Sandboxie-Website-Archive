				<div class="content">So i have disabled sandboxie from startups but through process explorer i see that everytime i boot up it creates a task, so i tried to put the sanboxie services as manual because otherwise i had to personally go and start it, then i tried configuring sandboxie from shell intergration to not start up but because i had to put the sandboxie service back to automatic it wont work and still starts up, any fixes?<br>
<br>
*very briefly what i said*<br>
i change the services to manual it doesnt work<br>
i configure it from shell integration to never start up, it still starts up<br>
<br>
MERGED TOPIC-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
i tried setting the sandboxie service from manual but it gives me an error, then i put it back to automatic and tried to stop the start up from windows shell integration but it still shows up as a task on process explorer, i tried both at the same time but it still gives me an error, what can i do?</div>

<br>
What are you trying to do exactly? What task are you seeing? <br>
What are the errors that you are receiving? <br>
If you do not want Sandboxie at all when your computer starts you can set the service to disabled, but you will need to manually enable it every time you want to use Sandboxie.  <br>

Here are a few similar topics / entries that might help you:<br>
