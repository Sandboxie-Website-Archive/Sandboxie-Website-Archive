				<div class="content">I use Sandboxie to allow me to be several users at at the same time in Aras Innovator.  (We have the paid version of SB)<br>
<br>
Sadly, recent versions of Sandboxie seem to have problems. (Current version is 4.16/64bit)<br>
<br>
The cursor goes missing in various dialogues and the delete button closes the IE10 window in which Aras runs.<br>
<br>
Aras makes heavy use of DotNet (.NET) and JavaScript.<br>
<br>
I've seen similar effects outside of Sandboxie that required a complete reset of IE, however doing this in SB and clearing the sandbox seems not to work.<br>
<br>
I've also tried creating new sandboxes that are not based on existing ones and that also has problems.<br>
<br>
I don't know what version of SB I was running before 4.16.</div>
