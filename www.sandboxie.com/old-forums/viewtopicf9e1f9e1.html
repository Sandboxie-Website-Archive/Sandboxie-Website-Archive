If IE is your default browser, it is being forced, and hyperlinks in MS Office are not working, you can use new option BlockIEEmbedding=y.</div>

				<div class="content">Cha-Ching- yup, I can see and post here while logged in again. /YAY! Been using 5.19.1 on my Win7 x64 for about a day now and haven't noticed any new issues. [Not to say the other stuff has vanished suddenly]  Oh and I almost forgot, I installed 5.19.1 then SBIE started asking me if I wanted 'to play a game' in a pretty odd voice. Scary stuff! :D I said no but it said oh well, then went on about some bomb here or there, I blame YOU.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the BlockIEEmbedding option btw! I wouldn't have known to want it till it was there (I actually remove the IE UI but I'm not sure this option depends on the ui) so until I figure that out I'm happy to be able to block it inside SBIE!</div>

Win 10 CU has somehow changed the way they send messages. We are looking into it. Minimize Chrome and the recovery dialog will appear.</div>

				<div class="content">Agreed - this fixed most of my issues as well.  Video is working again.  The immediate recovery pop-up continues to be an issue, though, using Firefox x64 v53.  I have not timed it, but it is delayed.  I can live with that much easier than the video thing, though.  Thanks!</div>

				<h3>Firefox will not play video</h3>

				<div class="content">Since around the time of the creator's update which also happens to be around the same time of upgrading to Firefox 53.0 (64bit), I've been experiencing issues trying to play video on multiple machines.  The video/image does not load.  It is just a black screen.  I've tried removing all addons that I used as well.  I've tried resetting the Sandbox and reinstalling the application from scratch to no avail.<br>
<br>
An example of content that I can't view is here:  <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/miFfK" class="postlink">http://imgur.com/gallery/miFfK</a> .  It seems to be sitting at the loading animation never ending.<br>
<br>
Youtube doesn't work.<br>
<br>
None of these play, but they don't give an error either: <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/html5/tests/video.html" class="postlink">https://www.quirksmode.org/html5/tests/video.html</a><br>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
Why is there a file named "counters2.dat" in the DefaultBox of Sandboxie 5.19.2? This file cannot be deleted and always there even when restart computer. I cannot clear the sandbox because of this file. This looks like a spyware or some kind of tracker to me. It was never there until I installed the latest beta version. Please clarify.<br>
<br>
Another problem I've found is that Chrome 58 x64 uses high CPU cycles when idled when running under Sandboxie. Running Chrome without Sandboxie, the CPU always stays at 0% according to Task Manager. I've noticed the antimalware keeps using CPU cycles also. I doubt it has something to do with the counters2.dat file which is very suspicious.<br>
<br>

<br>
UPDATE: I found it in my Sandbox after running a Windows Explorer search, it looks Windows related:<br>
C:\Sandbox\admin\SandboxName\user\current\Local Settings\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache   ---&gt; counters2.dat<br>
I did not have any issues deleting it.  <br>
<br>
What's the full path to the counter2.dat file? What actions did you perform (if you remember) that triggered this file to appear? <br>
<br>
Regarding the Chrome and Antimalware (which one?) comments, can you please provide more detailed information? <br>
Please have a look at this thread: <a href="viewtopic04f804f8.php?f=11&amp;t=24290&amp;p=127655&amp;hilit=Chrome+catroot#p127655" class="postlink">http://forums.sandboxie.com/phpBB3/view ... ot#p127655</a><br>

<br>
Here is the path of my sandbox which I moved to a virtual ramdisk drive created using RAM:<br>
Z:\Sandbox\Admin\DefaultBox\TEMP\counters2.dat<br>
<br>
I right-clicked on the Sandboxie taskbar icon and select "Delete Contents" which cannot be deleted. I manually navigate to that path and delete the whole folder and Windows 10 CU pops up a message about that file is in use and cannot be deleted. Sandboxie version 5.18 doesn't has this problem or this file exist. That file shouldn't be in the sandbox at all. <br>
<br>
Thanks</div>
