				<h3>Thunderbird - can't stop it writing back to system [SOLVED]</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Fri Feb 16, 2018 9:31 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I have up-to-date Windows 7 Pro (64), Thunderbird 52.6.0 (32), and licensed Sandboxie 5.23.3 (64).<br>
I've been running Thunderbird outside Sandboxie, no problem, and decided to try sandboxing it in it's own separate sandbox<br>
(called "QP" ... I'll also refer to Thunderbird as TB and Sandboxie as SB ...)<br>
1)  In SB settings for QP, in Program Start / Forced Programs, I added <span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>thunderbird.exe</em></span>.  With the yellow border, I can clearly see TB is running inside QP (and the Control Window shows those files open).<br>
2)  While QP/TB is running, I check for the <span style="text-decoration: underline">QP sandbox path</span> that virtualizes TB data (<em><span style="text-decoration: underline">C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird</span></em>) where I would expect to find the sandboxed data.  Wasn't there.<br>
3)  I downloaded some email inside SB, close the sandboxed TB, and checked again ... data not there in sandbox path.<br>
4)  Next, I opened TB <span style="text-decoration: underline">outside SB</span>, and there were my updated emails back in the system!  (<em>Without downloading them from the server.</em>)<br>
SB wrote data back to the system without permission (and seemingly on-the-fly).<br>
5)  Back in SB QP settings, I turned <span style="text-decoration: underline">off</span> Quick and Immediate Recovery, and added the system path (<em><span style="text-decoration: underline">C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird</span></em>) for TB data to Forced Folders ... ran TB in SB ... I could see SB running TB in QP ... same result ... no SB path data, and system gets written to.<br>
6)  All my other progs behave properly in SB.  Am I doing something wrong?  Is there an incompatibility with TB?<br>
Thanks,<br>
G.</div>

				<div class="content">Whoops, stumbled on my problem/solution ...<br>
Under Sandbox settings / Applications / Email Reader, I had Thunderbird checked.<br>
Without reading the heading carefully, I mistakenly thought that was keeping the data INSIDE the sandbox.<br>
Thanks anyway ... maybe this will helps someone with a similar problem.</div>
