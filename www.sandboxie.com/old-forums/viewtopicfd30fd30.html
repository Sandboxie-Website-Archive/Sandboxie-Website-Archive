Sandboxie 4.04<br>
Opera 12.16 (Build 1860)<br>
<br>
Opera mail was working as normal when sandboxed, until yesterday when I noticed that emails were only being sent/received when Opera was not sandboxed.<br>
<br>
This problem could possibly have started after applying yesterday's MS Windows updates.  It was a big update so I'm reluctant to uninstall all of them to test the theory.  <br>
I'm guessing that MS may have made some OS changes which have affected the way Sandboxie works under Windows 7 64 bit.<br>
I was wondering if anyone else was experiencing the same issue?</div>

				<div class="content">I had to downgrade to v3.76 because I can't send or receive email with The Bat! sandboxed under 4.04. I went back to 3.76 and it works fine. I tried 4.04 again and the same problem, so I am back to 3.76 for now.<br>

<br>
I've just reverted to Sandboxie v3.76 and Opera Mail is working again.  <br>
<br>
I should have tried this sooner.  What confused me was that Opera's RSS Feed was still working after I'd installed v4.04 the previous day so at a glance it looked like I was receiving messages ok after the upgrade (both emails and RSS messages arrive together in the Opera inbox).  I only noticed the problem today when I tried to send an email unsuccessfully.<br>
<br>
Looks like Sandboxie v4 still has a few bugs with email that need sorting out.  I'll just wait for the fix to be released, I would imagine tzuk is already on the case.</div>

				<div class="content">Do you use avast?  I know it blocks email from a sandboxed Thunderbird.  Perhaps the same also happens with TheBat and Opera?<br>

				<div class="content">Yes, I have Avast 8.0.1489 installed.<br>
<br>
So that would be it then.<br>
I may give Sandboxie 4.04 another try with Avast Mail Shield disabled.  I virtually always run Opera in a sandbox so I guess the Avast Mail Shield is not really necessary.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the reply, much appreciated.</div>

				<div class="content">Version 4.05.01 unfortunately does not fix the problem, but points you to the Known Conflicts page.<br>
