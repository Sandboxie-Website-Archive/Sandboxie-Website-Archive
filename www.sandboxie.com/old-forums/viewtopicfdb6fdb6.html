If those are what you are referring to, click the check box to 'not see this again' after making your choice.<br>
<br>
If they have a SBIExxxx message number, then you will need to quote those in a post here.<br>
There's a Copy button on those windows, to copy the message to the Clipboard.<blockquote><div><cite>robgrant wrote:</cite>Anyway, I put appointments in remiderfox date calendar and next time I open Firefox, they're not there. What am I doing wrong here?</div></blockquote>You're not doing anything wrong. It's just that files and folders that are created by sandboxed programs are actually saved inside the sandbox.<br>
So, if you want something to be saved outside of the sandbox, you need to give the sandboxed program permission to do that.<br>
<br>
Normally this will be a Direct Access setting, meaning that the sandboxed program can write directly to the specified files and folders that are outside of the sandbox. Otherwise, those writes will be kept in the sandbox and will be deleted when the sandbox contents are deleted.<br>
An unsandboxed Firefox will not see those writes.<br>
<br>
As far as ReminderFox is concerned, I spent a little time looking at where it saves its settings and data files.<br>
Settings and subscriptions are saved in the Firefox profile file "prefs.js". Many extensions save their settings in that file.<br>
Data is saved to files in a "reminderfox" sub-folder in the Firefox profile folder.<br>
<br>
There are a couple of choices:<br>
Use: Sandbox Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Web Browser &gt; Firefox<br>
"Allow direct access to entire Firefox profile folder"<br>
<strong>or,</strong><br>
Specify the above file/folders in Direct Access settings:<br>
Sandbox Settings &gt; Resource Access &gt; File Access &gt; Direct Access<br>
"Add Program" button: <strong>firefox.exe</strong><br>
"Add" button: Navigate to the Firefox profile folder. Select the "prefs.js" file and OK, in that window.<br>
Click Apply<br>
While "firefox.exe" is still showing in the box with the pull-down arrow:<br>
"Add" button: Navigate to and select the "reminderfox" sub-folder in the Firefox profile folder.<br>
OK your way out.<br>
<br>
It's possible that I might have missed something because I couldn't immediately identify where the program stores the setting if you "Suspend alerts and alarms". It may, or may not, remember that setting.</div>
