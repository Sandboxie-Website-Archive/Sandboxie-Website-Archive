				<h3>Created Sandboxies</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br>
<br>
I understand we can create unlimited sandboxies.<br>
<br>
The sandboxies are given a label as seen when you click on the above button Sandbox in the Sandboxie Control, a list appears with a label with numbers from 1 to 0. Zero representing number 10. Thereafter there will be no number 11 and thus 11 will be replaced with the letter A and so on to Z.<br>
<br>
However, we are limited thereafter Z when wanting to have more labels exceeding the limited amount of labels which is no more than 36 sandboxies. Meaning, we can have 36 sandboxies labeled but thereafter seems as though we can't.<br>
<br>
That is as i have discovered, could anyone tell me if i am wrong and that there is a way to continue giving labels to sandboxies 37 and on-words. The Thirty-Seventh sandbox is directly after Z but does not have a label. If you create more than 36 sandboxies, you can't have labels thereafter the last created sandbox 36.<br>
<br>
How do we give the Thirty-Seventh created sandbox a label-?<br>
<br>
Many thanks</div>

				<div class="content">Hi, yabbadoo, Brummelchen,<br>
<br>
Thanks for reply, i had a feeling somebody would ask this, the simple answer is and with respect, i can't divulge a project of mine, it is secrete, sorry guys.<br>
<br>
In any case and having said the above, you both however make valid remarks which however brings on questions to you both and anyone else looking in and that is: Why then can we make several sandboxes only to find we are limited <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?:" title="Question"> <br>
<br>
Also a two digit numbering does not solve the fact as explained in my initial post. I have made 110 sandboxies and only 36 of them can be labeled, obviously i can make many more but that's if i need more.<br>
<br>
I want if possible to label all of the sandboxies. maybe the answer will arise if i keep analyzing Sandboxie and master it or that somebody may know how and can cut a possible long ordeal ahead of me.<br>
<br>
Can and/or does grouping etc spring to anyone's mind, not that i know exactly what grouping does yet, i am merely trying anything to see if there is a way.<br>
<br>
Respects and thanks</div>

				<div class="content">Hi bo.elam,<br>
<br>
Thanx, you have at least illustrated another and more explained aspect as to "WHY" as per yabbadoo wanted to know.<br>
Link to Bo's response:<br>
<a href="viewtopic85a485a4.html?f=17&amp;t=24561#p128718" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=24561#p128718</a><br>
<br>
Brummelchen also comments as to the rare usage, false/true as it was at the time Brummelchen stated this to me, the fact that now i have been enlightened by you (bo.elam)  brings on the true aspect of in that Sandboxie has the obvious facility to do such and therefore cannot be rare.<br>
<br>
You have provided evidence to me and others looking in on this, which proves that the making of separate sandboxie' is indeed well needed   (to those who fully appreciate the need for separate sandboxie')   and well thought of in the creation of Sandboxie. Indeed Sandboxie has this fantastic feature and demonstrates sandboxie' true power that many as i have now witnessed are unaware of.<br>
<br>
Having said the above i do however feel that Sandboxie can be tremendously improved with simple but very effective features, such as and to be clear i stand to be corrected if i state an obvious that i have not recognized Sandboxies full perpetuals yet:<br>
1) As per what this subject is about.<br>
2) To place the created Sandboxie   (and for what ever purpose it was created for)   on the desktop or in a folder and then to simply run the saved individual Sandboxie's to then run and continue where you exactly left off.<br>
3) To make the placement of the Created Sandboxie's in the order that they are made and stay in that order, i.e: when numbering the Sandboxie.s they are indeed in the order that we all would appreciate it to be in and seen in. Explained: if you make the 9th sandboxie then the 10th should be following   thereafter and so on with number 99 sandboxie where the 100th would appear back to where the teen numbers are. I do understand that you can then move it with the up and down aspect, however can you imagine moving the 100th and 101 etc to the bottom where it should be after 99th sandboxie. Indeed an arduous task.<br>
4) That grouping in the seance as i see, to actually group Sandboies that would be separate projects. This so that when creating Sandboxies the separate folder-'Project' has the ability to then again use the number 1 etc.<br>
5) etc. etc. not exhaustive.</div>

				<div class="content">grouping means collecting boxes with same usage, terms whatever they share, could also be a plain name: 01 up 10, 11 up to 20. you can do grouping with the GUI function or in sandboxie.ini if you know how to.<br>
<a href="../index281c.html?SandboxMenu#layout" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?SandboxMenu#layout</a><br>
<br>
you can suggest numbering but i think it should be not sandboxies task to administrate - i never met any one using 100 boxes, ofc i state it as rare usage. numbering (without any other string) is more very rare because no one can have in mind which box is for which purpose. as written my boxes have a name for its purpose.<br>
<br>
and yes, it is possible to generate a sandboxie.ini with 100 boxes if you know the basics or use a template for a special tool which creates the ini file. but there exist no such tool.</div>

<br>
You can create groups in order to address the 36 labels limitation (as stated above by Brummelchen): <br>
<a href="../index281c.html?SandboxMenu#layout" class="postlink">https://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?SandboxMenu#layout</a><br>
<br>
Open Sandboxie Control ---&gt; Sandbox ---&gt; Set Layouts and Groups. <br>
By default, "Top" is the only group listed. Right click on it to create new groups.<br>
Right click on your Sandboxes to move them to the desired group.  <br>
Each new group will be assigned a label, and then will be able to hold 36 labels inside of them.<br>
<br>

I am going to look into what you both have mentioned. However at the moment i have also encountered BSOD issue whilst creating Sandboxies.<br>
<br>
I have made a new problem post, please see: <a href="viewtopic6385-26385.html?f=11&amp;t=24568" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=24568</a></div>
