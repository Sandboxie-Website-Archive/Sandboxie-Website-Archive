				<div class="content">I can't find an entry for eastern time, usually boards will have an entry like "eastern time" or "new york". I set it to Atikokan which is in Canada and according to wikipedia unofficially observes eastern standard time all year round. Basically I would like a time entry that automatically adjusts for daylight saving time because I logged in just now and the timestamps were off by an hour and I realize what happened is my timezone is set to -4 but it should be -5 since EST is in effect now instead of EDT.<br>

				<div class="content">Hello cornflake,<br>
<br>
Logged in users set their timezone during registration and can change it in their user control panel.<br>
Once you select the desired time zone, you can pick the location that you want. For example, mine is set to UTC -05 - America/New York. <br>
<br>
If you were using UTC -04, you should have received a suggestion next to your time zone to switch to -05.<br>
<br>
