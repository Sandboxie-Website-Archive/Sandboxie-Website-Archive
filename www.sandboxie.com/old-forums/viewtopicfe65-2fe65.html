				<h3>Updated Review Of 4.06:</h3>

				<div class="content">I am writing this updated review today, on 10.29:<br>
<br>
The 4.06 does appear to SLIGHTLY slow down my browsing compared to version 3.76.  I didn't make the connection earlier. However, if I am right, this is only a negligable difference concerning speed, and for such a small difference, I would still gladly trade a slight amount of speed for enhanced security. Therefore, I did not think it was appropriate of me to post this review on the "Negative" area. However, I would humbily suggest to TZuk if he considers adding more processes and features in newer versions, that he might try to find ways to prevent those changes from any potential further slowdowns. One suggestion might be to make any future additions to processes as optiions via checkboxes for each user to decide.  Again, all-and-all,  no such thing as a perfect program and i'll continue to rave about Sandboxie and thank TZuk for it.<br>
