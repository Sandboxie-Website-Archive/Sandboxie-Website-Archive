				<h3>Sandbox for Linux</h3>

				<div class="content">I am so thankful that someone finally has authored a sandboxing software that is affordable.  It has cut my cleanup time almost in half, I now only have to respond to user-ignorance cases now.<br>
<br>
I am very much a npos-centric (non-propietary operating system) person however and I am always looking for ways to expand my own safety.  I was curious though if Sandboxie could be ported for standalone use in *nix systems?<br>
At the moment the solution that I have is a gpgzipped file of my entire home directory that I have to manually run to replace all the artifacts that x-win programs leave behind or creates, a small inconvenience but still an inconvenience partially because it cannot be automated and must be updated frequently.<br>
<br>
If I could sandbox even half of the applications that I run, this could considerably improve my life.  As it is a school network, I cannot make any special requests to make modifications to the system but if it could be executed with my group and permissions I would be happy with that.<br>
<br>
Cheers.</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you for the suggestions, but Sandboxie on platforms that are not Windows would have nothing in common with Sandboxie on Windows, except for the name.  In other words, there is no reason that I should bring application virtualization to these platforms, and not someone else.  So please ask someone else.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>
