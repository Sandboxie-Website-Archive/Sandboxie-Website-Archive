But as said also without Aster Installed only 1 User  and Sandboxie get this BSOD with OpenWinClass *
</div></blockquote>

Ah I must have missed that when skimming over all the posts. I downloaded and tried it in a VM but it seems Aster has the same issue with the workspace in a VM as it does with stuff in Sandboxie and I can't even see when I move the mouse on an unsandboxed workspace started by aster after a reboot. Doesn't look like I'm gonna get very far testing or reproducing this in a simple VM so I doubt I end up being much help:-/<br>
<br>
I was able to keyboard test one program with the resource access monitor open and only saw two things to attempt opening instead of * but as my mouse wasn't working anyway I couldn't tell if it would change anything.<br>
Instead of<br>
OpenWinClass=*<br>
<br>
Would you be willing to see if adding these two instead changes anything and gets the mouse working? I'd be shocked if it actually did but no harm at least testing it I guess?<br>
OpenWinClass=OLLYDBG<br>
OpenWinClass=WinDbgFrameClass
</div></blockquote>
<strong><br>
I see mouse in aster or sandboxie as said cannot control windows outside sandboxie when in tightvnc or steam inhome streaming  because openwinclass ' make BSOD.     <br>
<br>
Also have BSOD without Aster installed in sandboxie with Openwinclass *  <br>
<br>
<br>
I think you must set in VM at Aster Workstation at the Monitor display right click and set Hardware Cursor think its a VM problem.<br>
<br>
Thanks tested with <br>
OpenWinClass=OLLYDBG<br>
OpenWinClass=WinDbgFrameClass  <br>
<br>
But still nothing is controllable only the seam window that is sandboxed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also think OpenWinClass * is needed because if user opens something from windows taskbar or startmenu that is not sandboxed then its or so <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br>
<br>
You also know no alternative then Sandboxie todo that what i do and worked always good since BSODs  or how do find why OpenWinClass * makes the BSODs with APC_INDEX_MISSMATCH ?<br>

				<h3>Ace Online in Sandboxie causes BSOD after Win 10 Creators Update</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Thu Sep 21, 2017 4:36 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Kevin87</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Hello all, <br>
<br>
I wish to report an issue with the game "Ace Online", hosted by Subagames. It ran well in Sandboxie 5.20 in Windows 10 before the Creators Update. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, after upgrading to the Windows 10 Creators Update, Windows crashes with a bsod when Ace Online is started within Sandboxie. This happens on all pc's and laptops I own that run the Windows 10 Creators Update. It doesn't seem to matter if it's Windows 10 Home or Pro.<br>
<br>
What additional information do you require? Maybe it’s an idea to check out the game yourself on <a href="https://ace.subagames.com/index.aspx" class="postlink">https://ace.subagames.com/index.aspx</a><br>
<br>
In case you wish to try the game yourself to figure out what is causing this issue, some steps need to be performed when creating a sandbox to run the game. These settings are confirmed to work in Windows 7 and Windows 10 (before the Creators update): <br>
<br>
Create a new sandbox – Copy settings from “none”<br>
Set the following sandbox settings:
<ul><li>Restrictions- drop rights- checkbox has to be unchecked.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Resource access – file access – full access – add – c:\Suba Games\ - apply. (or whatever location you install the game to)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Resource access – window access – add - * - ok – apply</li></ul>

<br>
Note: Once you are logged in into the game, the game (whether in Sandboxie or not) can crash if admin rights are asked by another program. This is independent on the usage of Sandboxie or any version of Windows and does not happen all the time. I assume this is completely unrelated.<br>
<br>
If you require more information, I'm happy to provide this.</div>

<br>
We are aware that using "OpenWinClass=* " triggers a Blue Screen when using Windows 10 CU .<br>
Why do you need to use that option?<br>
<br>
Please re-try after removing:<br>
Resource access – window access – add - * - ok – apply<br>
<br>

I have been trying to repro this issue on Windows 10 x 64 FCU without success. <br>
Are you still seeing the problem with the latest Windows update + Sbie 5.23.1 ? <br>
