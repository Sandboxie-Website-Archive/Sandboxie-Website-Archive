I can't think of anything in 4.17 that would cause this behavior.  There was a small change made in the clipboard code.  How are you trying to copy these files?  Can you try copying by another method (e.g. cmd prompt)?</div>

bjm, please read opening post in this thread from Norton forum. It seems coNatHst has a problem terminating even without Sandboxie being involved in the mix. I think, once again, the solution to your SBIE and Chrome issues is to disable Identity Safe.<br>

One user.  Really, your proof is standing on one unresolved abandoned locked Topic from last year ...  Really.  <br>
<br>
I'm not having any issue with conathstexe.   Running non-sandbox Chrome now.  No worries.  <br>
No lingering Chrome processes.<br>
http causes browser alert.  Use https.  Norton Community is https<br>

Hi Curt,<br>
<br>
I'm using the windows right click context menu "copy" and "paste."<br>
<br>
[Beta 4.17.8]<br>
<br>
Steps to reproduce issue (Windows 7 SP1 x86) when copying files from outside the sandbox and pasting into a sandbox folder:
<ul>
<li>1. (Non-sandbox Desktop) Right click--&gt;New--&gt;Text Document (name it "Sandbox.txt")<br>
2. Open the "Sandbox.txt" file and type in "Testing" and save the file<br>
3. Click on Sandboxie Control and click on "Sandbox DefaultBox" <br>
4. Right click--&gt;Run Sandboxed--&gt;Run Windows Explorer (Sandbox Windows Explorer)<br>
5. (Sandbox Windows Explorer) - go to any sandbox folder (ex. Sandbox "My Documents" - C:\Users\User\Documents)<br>
6. (Non-sandbox Desktop) Right click on "Sandbox.txt" and pick "copy".<br>
7. Right click on a blank area within the (Sandbox "My Documents" folder) and pick "paste"<br>
8. Observe that the "Sandbox.txt" file does not appear in the (Sandbox "My Documents" folder)</li>
</ul>

Steps to reproduce issue (Windows 7 SP1 x86) when copying files from one sandbox folder and pasting to another sandbox folder:
<ul>
<li>1. Click on Sandboxie Control and click on "Sandbox DefaultBox" <br>
2. Right click--&gt;Run Sandboxed--&gt;Run Windows Explorer (Sandbox Windows Explorer)<br>
3. (Sandbox Windows Explorer) - go to any sandbox folder (ex. Sandbox "My Documents" - C:\Users\User\Documents)<br>
4. Right click on a blank area within the (Sandbox "My Documents" folder) and pick "New"--&gt;Text Document (name it "Digital.txt")<br>
5. Open "Digital.txt" and type in "Testing" and save the file<br>
6. Right click on "Digital.txt" and choose "copy"<br>
7. (Sandbox "My Documents" folder) - go to another sandbox folder such as (ex. Sandbox "Downloads" - C:\Users\User\Downloads)<br>
8. Right click on a blank area within the (Sandbox "Downloads" folder) and pick "paste"<br>
9. Observe that the "Digital.txt" file does not appear in the (Sandbox "Downloads" folder)</li>
</ul>

No issue when copying a file from a sandbox folder to outside the sandbox:
<ul>
<li>1. Create "Virtual.txt" file in (Sandbox "Downloads" folder)<br>
2. Open "Virtual.txt" file and type in "Testing" and save it <br>
3. Right click on "Virtual.txt" and choose "copy" <br>
4. Go to (non-sandbox Desktop) and right click--&gt;"paste" ("Virtual.txt" file appears in non-sandbox Desktop)</li>
</ul>

As for another copying method, I added this registry key a couple of years ago (<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows/add-copy-to-move-to-to-the-windows-explorer-right-click-menu/" class="postlink">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows/ ... lick-menu/</a>) outside the sandbox. This key adds "copy to folder" to the right click context menu. "Copy to folder" does work when copying files from one sandbox folder to another sandbox folder. <br>
<br>
Command Prompt also works if I use the copy command (Run Sandboxed--&gt;Run Any Program--&gt;Type in cmd--&gt;Type in command: copy C:\Users\User\Downloads\Virtual.txt C:\Users\User\Documents)</div>

I am having trouble with copy/paste hyperlinks in Gmail using both Firefox (latest official release) and Internet Explorer.  The result of the hyperlink paste is plain text.  I have no problem copy/paste hyperlinks in Yahoo Mail.<br>
<br>
I rolled back to Sandboxie 4.17.3 Beta and the problem no longer exists.  I rolled back to 4.17.3 because I had not previously downloaded 4.17.4 or 4.17.5.<br>
